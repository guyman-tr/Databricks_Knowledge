## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Fact_CustomerAction` is the unified customer event log for the eToro platform. Every significant action a customer performs — opening a position, closing a position, depositing money, withdrawing, logging in, publishing a social post, receiving a fee, getting a bonus, registering an account — is captured as a single row in this table. It answers: "What did this customer do, when, and what were the financial details?"

The table consolidates events from five distinct production sources into a single ActionTypeID-driven schema:
1. **Position opens** (ActionTypeID 1-3, 39): From `Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay` via the Generic Pipeline + staging
2. **Position closes** (ActionTypeID 4-6, 28, 40): From `History.ClosePositionEndOfDay` via the Generic Pipeline + staging
3. **Credit/financial events** (ActionTypeID 7-13, 15-20, 27, 30, 32, 34-38, 42-45): From `History.Credit` (which unions `History.ActiveCredit` + archived Credit partition tables back to 2007)
4. **Logins** (ActionTypeID 14): From `STS_Audit_UserOperationsData` (Session Tracking Service) with platform/browser detection
5. **Registrations** (ActionTypeID 41): From `Customer.CustomerStatic`

Because the table unions fundamentally different event types, **most columns are only populated for specific ActionTypeIDs**. Position-related columns (InstrumentID, Leverage, Commission, IsBuy, etc.) are NULL/0 for non-position events. Fee-specific columns (IsFeeDividend, DividendID) are only set for ActionTypeID=35. This is a sparse fact table by design.

The data originates from production systems, flows through the Azure Data Lake and DWH staging tables, and is loaded by `SP_Fact_CustomerAction_DL_To_Synapse` (staging extract) and `SP_Fact_CustomerAction` (transform + load). Post-load, `SP_Fact_CustomerAction_IsParitalCloseParent` marks partial-close parents. The load uses SWITCH partition for daily increments.

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 ActionTypeID — Event Classification

**What**: Every row is classified by ActionTypeID, which determines what type of customer action occurred and which columns are populated.

**Columns Involved**: `ActionTypeID`, mapped via `DWH_dbo.Dim_ActionType`

**Rules**:

| ActionTypeID | Name | Category | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ManualPositionOpen | PositionOpen | Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay — MirrorID=0, OrigParentPositionID=0 |
| 2 | CopyPositionOpen | PositionOpen | Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay — MirrorID>0, OrigParentPositionID>0 |
| 3 | CopyPlusPositionOpen | PositionOpen | Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay — MirrorID=0, OrigParentPositionID>0 |
| 4 | ManualPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 5 | CopyPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 6 | CopyPlusPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 7 | Deposit | Deposit | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=1) |
| 8 | Cashout | Cashout | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=2) |
| 9 | Bonus | Bonus | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=7) |
| 10 | Cashout request | Cashout request | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=9) |
| 11 | Chargeback | Chargeback | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=11) |
| 12 | Refund | Refund | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=12) |
| 14 | LoggedIn | LoggedIn | STS_Audit_UserOperationsData |
| 15 | Account balance to mirror | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=18) |
| 16 | Mirror balance to account | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=19) |
| 17 | Register new mirror | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=20) |
| 18 | Unregister mirror | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=21) |
| 19 | Detach position from mirror | DetachPosition | History.Credit |
| 21-26 | Publish Post/Comment/Like, Received Post/Comment/Like | Social engagement | **DEAD DATA** — legacy rows exist but no longer updated. No active ETL. |
| 27 | DepositAttempt | DepositAttempt | History.Credit |
| 28 | DetachedPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 29 | Cashier Loggin | Cashier login | Billing.Login |
| 30 | Processed Cashout | Processed Cashout | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=2 processed) |
| 32 | Edit StopLoss | Edit StopLoss | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=13) |
| 34 | Open Stock Order | Stock order | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=29) |
| 35 | End Of The Week Fee | Fees | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=14) — overnight, weekend, dividend, SDRT, ticket fees |
| 36 | Compensation | Compensation | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=6) |
| 37 | Reverse cashout | Reverse cashout | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=8) |
| 38 | Affiliate Deposit | Deposit | History.Credit |
| 39 | PositionOpenTypeUnknown | PositionOpen | Position open without matching History.Credit (fix at weekly maintenance) |
| 40 | PositionCloseTypeUnknown | PositionClose | Position close without matching History.Credit |
| 41 | Customer Registration | Registration | Customer.CustomerStatic |
| 42 | Cashout Rollback | Chargeback | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=33) |
| 43 | Reverse Deposit | Reverse Deposit | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=32) |
| 44 | InternalDeposit | Deposit | History.Credit (MoveMoneyReasonID=5) |
| 45 | InternalWithdraw | Withdraw | History.Credit (MoveMoneyReasonID=5) |

### 2.2 IsFeeDividend — Fee Sub-Classification

**What**: For ActionTypeID=35 (End of Week Fee), classifies the specific fee type.

**Columns Involved**: `IsFeeDividend`, `Description`

**Rules** (per DSM-1463):
- `1` = Overnight/weekend fee (Description: "Over night fee", "Weekend fee")
- `2` = Dividend payment (Description LIKE '%dividend%')
- `3` = SDRT charge (Description LIKE '%sdrt%')
- `4` = Ticket fees (Description: "OpenTotalFees" or "CloseTotalFees")
- `NULL` = Not ActionTypeID=35

### 2.3 Position-Derived Columns (Shared with Dim_Position)

**What**: ~33 columns in Fact_CustomerAction are copies of the same data from `Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay` / `History.ClosePositionEndOfDay` that also populates `DWH_dbo.Dim_Position`. These columns display the same data under the same column names but are populated independently at ETL time.

**Shared columns**: `PositionID`, `InstrumentID`, `Amount`, `Leverage`, `Commission`, `CommissionOnClose`, `FullCommission`, `FullCommissionOnClose`, `MirrorID`, `IsSettled`, `InitialUnits`, `IsDiscounted`, `CommissionByUnits`, `FullCommissionByUnits`, `RegulationIDOnOpen`, `ReopenForPositionID`, `IsReOpen`, `CommissionOnCloseOrig`, `FullCommissionOnCloseOrig`, `OriginalPositionID`, `IsPartialCloseParent`, `IsPartialCloseChild`, `IsAirDrop`, `SettlementTypeID`, `DLTOpen`, `DLTClose`, `OpenMarkupByUnits`, `IsBuy`, `NetProfit`, `RedeemStatus`, `RedeemID`, `IsRedeem`

**Rules**:
- These columns are ONLY populated for position events (ActionTypeID IN 1-6, 28, 39, 40)
- For non-position events, these columns are 0 or NULL
- The ETL joins from staging tables directly — NOT from Dim_Position itself
- Column meanings are identical to Dim_Position (see `Dim_Position.md` for detailed descriptions)

### 2.4 PlatformID — Product/Platform Resolution

**What**: Identifies which product/platform the action originated from. Badly named — it's actually a FK to `Dim_Product.ProductID`, not a standalone platform enum.

**Columns Involved**: `PlatformID`

**Rules**:
- Only populated for ActionTypeID=14 (logins) and 41 (registrations)
- Resolve via JOIN to `DWH_dbo.Dim_Product` — provides Product, Platform, and SubPlatform columns
- Do NOT hard-code value mappings (101=Android, etc.) — always JOIN to Dim_Product

**Query pattern**:
```sql
SELECT dp.Product, dp.Platform, dp.SubPlatform, fca.*
FROM DWH_dbo.Fact_CustomerAction fca
JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_Product dp ON fca.PlatformID = dp.ProductID
WHERE fca.ActionTypeID = 14
```

### 2.6 Reopen Commission Adjustment

**What**: For reopened positions (IsReOpen=1), the commission at close is adjusted.

**Columns Involved**: `CommissionOnClose`, `FullCommissionOnClose`, `CommissionOnCloseOrig`, `FullCommissionOnCloseOrig`, `IsReOpen`, `ReopenForPositionID`

**Rules**:
- `CommissionOnClose = new_position.CommissionOnClose - original_position.CommissionOnClose`
- `CommissionOnCloseOrig` / `FullCommissionOnCloseOrig` preserve original values

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is HASH-distributed on `RealCID` with a CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX + 4 nonclustered indexes (`ActionTypeID+DateID`, `ActionTypeID`, `CompensationReasonID`, `RealCID+DateID`). Always include `RealCID` in WHERE or JOIN for optimal single-distribution queries. The columnstore index enables efficient analytical scans across the ~11B rows.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, this table is stored as **Delta** (EXTERNAL, ~430 GB, ~7K files), partitioned by `etr_y`, `etr_ym`, `etr_ymd` (year, year-month, year-month-day). Always include partition columns in WHERE clauses for partition pruning — e.g., `WHERE etr_y = '2025' AND etr_ym = '202503'` will skip scanning irrelevant partitions. Given the table's ~11B rows, partition pruning is critical for any practical query. The partition columns are Databricks-layer additions not present in the Synapse source. Deletion vectors are enabled (`delta.enableDeletionVectors = true`).

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| All logins for a customer | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 14 AND RealCID = @cid` |
| Position opens in a date range | `WHERE ActionTypeID IN (1,2,3) AND DateID BETWEEN @start AND @end` |
| Revenue (commissions) | `WHERE ActionTypeID IN (1,2,3,4,5,6,28) AND Commission > 0` |
| Deposits for a customer | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 7 AND RealCID = @cid` |
| Overnight fees | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 35 AND IsFeeDividend = 1` |
| Dividend payments | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 35 AND IsFeeDividend = 2` |
| First-time deposits (FTD) | `WHERE IsFTD = 1` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_ActionType` | `ON fca.ActionTypeID = dat.ActionTypeID` | Action type name and category |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer` | `ON fca.RealCID = dc.RealCID` | Customer demographics, country |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Instrument` | `ON fca.InstrumentID = di.InstrumentID` | Instrument name (position events only) |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Position` | `ON fca.PositionID = dp.PositionID` | Full position details (avoid when possible — heavy join on 11B rows) |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_BonusType` | `ON fca.BonusTypeID = dbt.BonusTypeID` | Bonus type name, IsWithdrawable (bonus events only) |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Campaign` | `ON fca.CampaignID = dcm.CampaignID` | Campaign code, description, dates |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Country` | `ON fca.CountryIDByIP = dco.CountryID` | Country name from IP geolocation |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_FundingType` | `ON fca.FundingTypeID = dft.FundingTypeID` | Payment method name (deposit/cashout events) |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_PaymentStatus` | `ON fca.PaymentStatusID = dps.PaymentStatusID` | Payment status name |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Product` | `ON fca.PlatformID = dp.ProductID` | Product, Platform, SubPlatform (logins/registrations only) |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Date` | `ON fca.DateID = dd.DateID` | Calendar attributes |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Regulation` | `ON fca.RegulationIDOnOpen = dr.ID` | Regulation name |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **Most columns are only populated for specific ActionTypeIDs.** InstrumentID, Leverage, Commission, IsBuy are all 0/NULL for logins, deposits, social events, etc.
- **11 billion rows** — always filter by ActionTypeID + DateID to avoid full scans
- **IsReal is always 1** in this table — it only contains real-account actions (no demo)
- **Leverage=0 means non-position event**, not "no leverage". For actual position opens, Leverage=1 means no leverage (real ownership)
- **IsBuy NULL** means non-position event. For position events: True=Buy, False=Sell
- **Description is sparse** — only populated for fee events (ActionTypeID=35) and a few others. Contains human-readable strings like "Over night fee", "Payment caused by dividend", "OpenTotalFees"
- **PlatformTypeID** vs **PlatformID**: PlatformTypeID is a legacy field (0=default, 99=STS); PlatformID is a FK to `Dim_Product.ProductID` (badly named — always JOIN to Dim_Product, don't hard-code values)
- **StatusID is nearly always 1** (~11B rows with StatusID=1, ~2M NULL)
- **DemoCID is always 0** (real accounts only)
- **HistoryID is NOT unique** — despite being intended as a key, it contains duplicates. Never use it for JOINs, deduplication, or row identification

## 1. Business Meaning

Fact_SnapshotCustomer is the central customer state table in the DWH. For every eToro customer (RealCID), it holds one row per distinct attribute state within a year, recording which attributes were active between FromDate and ToDate (encoded together in `DateRangeID`). The pattern is SCD Type 2 by year: each year's rows are closed as attribute changes occur, and a new open row is created with the updated state. At year-end, all open rows are closed and reopened with the new year's date range.

As of 2026-03-19: **406M+ total rows**, **46.4M distinct customers**, data from **2007-08-22 to present**. 302M rows are "currently open" (ToDate = year-end). 11.9% of current open rows represent depositors; 98.0% are valid customers (IsValidCustomer=1).

The SP loads data from 6 source systems via staging Ext_FSC tables pre-populated by SP_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_DL_To_Synapse. The core CC (Customer Core) source provides demographics and status; the BO (Back Office) source provides risk/compliance attributes. RegulationID is taken from RegulationChangeLog — **not** from Back Office — because regulation changes take effect end-of-day.

8 legacy columns (DemoCID, CustomerChangeTypeID, CurentValue, PreviousValue, DocsOK, Bankruptcy, PremiumAccount, Evangelist) are present in the DDL but NOT populated by the current SP. They carry DEFAULT (0) values.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 SCD Type 2 Pattern — DateRangeID

**What**: Each customer-state row has a DateRangeID encoding both the open date (FromDate) and close date (ToDate) as a 12-digit bigint.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `RealCID`

**Rules**:
- DateRangeID = `YYYYMMDD` (open date, 8 chars) + `MMDDD` (year-end month+day, 4 chars) → e.g., `202603101231` = opened 2026-03-10, closes 2026-12-31
- When an attribute changes, the SP updates DateRangeID of the existing row to close it (right 4 chars become yesterday's MMDD), then inserts a new row with today's open date + year-end
- To get the **most current row** per customer: `RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4) = '1231'`
- On January 1st: all prior year's open rows are closed (12-31) and re-opened for the new year
- The `Dim_Range` dimension table stores FromDateID + ToDateID for each DateRangeID

### 2.2 IsValidCustomer — Segment Flag

**What**: Computed flag indicating whether a customer is a "valid" retail customer for analytics (excludes demo, blocked countries, excluded labels).

**Columns Involved**: `IsValidCustomer`, `PlayerLevelID`, `LabelID`, `CountryID`

**Rules** (as of post-2020-03-14):
```
IsValidCustomer = 1 IF:
  PlayerLevelID <> 4 (not demo)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (30, 26) (not internal/excluded label)
  AND CountryID <> 250 (not blocked country)
ELSE 0
```
Pre-2020-03-14 rule additionally excluded AccountTypeID=9.

### 2.3 IsCreditReportValidCB — Credit Reporting Flag

**What**: Flag indicating whether a customer is eligible for credit report validation (CB = CreditBureau context).

**Columns Involved**: `IsCreditReportValidCB`, `PlayerLevelID`, `AccountTypeID`, `LabelID`, `CountryID`

**Rules** (as of post-2020-03-14):
```
IsCreditReportValidCB = 1 IF:
  NOT (PlayerLevelID = 4 AND AccountTypeID <> 2)  (not non-real demo)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (26, 30)
  AND NOT (CountryID = 250 AND CID NOT IN (3400616, 10526243))
ELSE 0
```

### 2.4 RegulationID — End-of-Day Rule

**What**: A customer's regulatory jurisdiction is taken from RegulationChangeLog (end-of-day change), NOT from the back-office system (immediate change), because regulation changes take effect at end of day for business/legal reasons.

**Columns Involved**: `RegulationID`, sourced from `Ext_FSC_BackOffice_RegulationChangeLog.ToRegulationID`

### 2.5 GDPR Erasure Masking

**What**: When a GDPR deletion request is processed, the UserName in Customer Core gets a `DelUserName` prefix. The SP detects this and masks Email, City, Address, Zip, and PhoneNumber in Fact_SnapshotCustomer.

**Columns Involved**: `Email`, `City`, `Address`, `Zip`, `PhoneNumber`

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, HASH(RealCID) distribution + CCI makes per-customer aggregations and filters on RealCID highly efficient — queries that filter or join on RealCID benefit from colocation. The NCI on RealCID provides efficient point-lookup for single customers.

**Warning**: With 406M rows, full table scans are expensive. Always filter by DateRangeID or a specific year range when possible.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage

**In Databricks**, the data is accessed via `V_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_FromDateID` (generic_id=1115), not directly. Two UC targets:
- `pii_data.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_v_fact_snapshotcustomer_fromdateid` — full PII (gated access)
- `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_v_fact_snapshotcustomer_fromdateid_masked` — Email/City/Address/Zip masked

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Current state for all customers | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` |
| Current state for one customer | `WHERE RealCID = @cid AND RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` |
| Customer state on a specific date | `WHERE RealCID = @cid AND LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),8) <= @date AND RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) >= RIGHT(@date, 4)` |
| Count of depositors | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231' AND IsDepositor = 1` |
| Valid retail customers | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231' AND IsValidCustomer = 1` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Country | ON f.CountryID = dc.CountryID | Country name/region |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Label | ON f.LabelID = dl.LabelID | Brand/label name |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Language | ON f.LanguageID = dl.LanguageID | Customer language |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_VerificationLevel | ON f.VerificationLevelID = dv.VerificationLevelID | KYC verification status |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_PlayerStatus | ON f.PlayerStatusID = dp.PlayerStatusID | Account lifecycle status |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Regulation | ON f.RegulationID = dr.RegulationID | Regulatory jurisdiction |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_AccountStatus | ON f.AccountStatusID = das.AccountStatusID | Account enabled/disabled |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Range | ON f.DateRangeID = dr.DateRangeID | Decode FromDateID + ToDateID |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_Guru_Copiers | ON f.RealCID = fg.RealCID | Copy-trading activity |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **DateRangeID is NOT a date** — it is a 12-digit bigint encoding (FromDate)(ToDate MMDD). Always extract with LEFT(...,8) for FromDate and RIGHT(...,4) for ToDate MMDD.
- **Most-current-row filter**: `RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` gets the currently open row, but after year-end closure this may temporarily return 0 rows. Use `MAX(DateRangeID)` per RealCID as a safer alternative.
- **Legacy columns with 0 defaults**: DemoCID, CustomerChangeTypeID, CurentValue, PreviousValue, DocsOK, Bankruptcy, PremiumAccount, Evangelist are all DEFAULT 0 and NOT populated by the current SP. Do not rely on them.
- **PII masking**: Email, City, Address, Zip are dynamically masked (`MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'default()')`). Users without `UNMASK` permission see NULL. PhoneNumber is NOT masked at DDL level but is GDPR-erased via the SP for deleted users.
- **WeekendFeePrecentage** (note: typo in column name — "Precentage" instead of "Percentage") — use as-is.
- **AccountStatusID distribution**: 1=93.2% (Active), 0=6.1% (unknown/default), 2=0.9% (Inactive). Only 3 distinct values observed.
- **Not exported directly to UC** — join via `V_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_FromDateID` in UC.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_PlayerLevel defines the eToro Club loyalty program tiers that segment customers by their realized equity (account value). Each tier grants progressively better benefits: faster cashout processing, higher service priority, and dedicated account management. The tiers in ascending rank are: Bronze -> Silver -> Gold -> Platinum -> Platinum Plus -> Diamond, plus a special Internal tier for employee/test accounts.

The data originates from `etoro.Dictionary.PlayerLevel` on the etoroDB-REAL production SQL Server. The Generic Pipeline exports this table daily (Override strategy) to `Bronze/etoro/Dictionary/PlayerLevel/` in the data lake. Production has 7 active tier rows (IDs 1-7); DWH adds a synthetic ID=0 N/A placeholder.

**CRITICAL SCHEMA DRIFT**: The DWH ETL loads only 8 of the production's 13 columns. The following production columns are DROPPED and not available in DWH: `RealizedEquityFrom`, `RealizedEquityTo` (the primary tier qualification thresholds), `IsWalletRedeemAllowed`, `ThresholdPercentToCurrentLevel`, and `DaysInRiskBeforeDowngrade`. For tier qualification logic, query the upstream `etoro.Dictionary.PlayerLevel` directly or the upstream wiki. The DWH table is suitable only for resolving tier names and cashout hours -- not for equity-based tier evaluation.

Loaded by `SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse` via TRUNCATE + INSERT from staging, followed by a separate INSERT VALUES for the ID=0 N/A sentinel using `@ddate` (midnight timestamp). Refreshes daily.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Tier Hierarchy and Rank Order

**What**: Six customer-facing loyalty tiers plus one internal tier, ranked by realized equity.

**Columns Involved**: `PlayerLevelID`, `Name`, `Sort`

**Rules**:
- IDs are NOT in rank order -- use `Sort` column for display ordering.
- Sort order: 0=Internal (excluded), 1=Bronze, 2=Silver, 3=Gold, 4=Platinum, 5=Platinum Plus, 6=Diamond.
- Internal (ID=4) is excluded from customer-facing reports: `WHERE PlayerLevelID <> 4`.
- ID=0 (N/A) is a DWH-only ETL placeholder for NULL FK safety. Not in production.

**Diagram**:
```
Tier Hierarchy (by Sort/Rank):
  Sort 1 = Bronze     (ID=1) -- entry level
  Sort 2 = Silver     (ID=5)
  Sort 3 = Gold       (ID=3)
  Sort 4 = Platinum   (ID=2)
  Sort 5 = Platinum + (ID=6)
  Sort 6 = Diamond    (ID=7) -- top tier
  Sort 0 = Internal   (ID=4) -- excluded
  (ID=0  = N/A       -- DWH ETL placeholder)
```

### 2.2 Cashout Processing Speed by Tier

**What**: Higher tiers receive priority cashout processing as a loyalty benefit.

**Columns Involved**: `CashoutPendingHours`

**Rules**:
- **120 hours (5 days)**: Bronze (1), Silver (5), Internal (4), N/A (0)
- **72 hours (3 days)**: Gold (3)
- **24 hours (1 day)**: Platinum (2), Platinum Plus (6), Diamond (7)
- This is one of the most impactful benefits of upper tier membership.

### 2.3 Legacy Lot/Deposit Thresholds (Deprecated)

**What**: Historical tier qualification fields -- superseded by RealizedEquity (not in DWH).

**Columns Involved**: `FromSumLotCount`, `ToSumLotCount`, `FromSumDeposit`, `ToSumDeposit`

**Rules**:
- All set to `-1` for Platinum (2), Platinum Plus (6), Diamond (7) -- meaning "disabled/not applicable".
- Bronze (1) has 1-3000 lots, $0-$999 deposit; Silver (5) has 3001-20000 lots, $1000-$4999; Gold (3) has 20001-100000 lots, $5000-$19999.
- These columns are legacy artifacts. The current tier system uses `RealizedEquityFrom/To` which are NOT loaded into DWH.
- Value -1 = "threshold disabled -- upper tier, equity-based qualification only".

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with a HEAP index. HEAP (no clustering) is unusual for dimension tables -- most Dim_ tables use CLUSTERED INDEX. With only 8 rows, HEAP is not a concern for performance but means scans are unordered. Always use `ORDER BY Sort` for consistent tier display.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, this table lands as `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_playerlevel`. With 8 rows, no partitioning or Z-ORDER is needed.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| What tier is a customer in? | JOIN Dim_Customer ON PlayerLevelID for Name |
| Tier distribution of customer base | GROUP BY PlayerLevelID, exclude Internal (ID=4) |
| Display tiers in rank order | ORDER BY Sort ASC, exclude ID=0 and ID=4 |
| Cashout processing time for a tier | SELECT CashoutPendingHours WHERE PlayerLevelID = X |
| What are the equity thresholds? | NOT available in DWH -- use upstream wiki or prod data |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON dc.PlayerLevelID = dpl.PlayerLevelID | Resolve tier name per customer |
| DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer | ON vdc.PlayerLevelID = dpl.PlayerLevelID | View-level tier resolution |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer | ON fsc.PlayerLevelID = dpl.PlayerLevelID | Tier in daily snapshots |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **IDs are NOT in rank order**: PlayerLevelID 2=Platinum, 3=Gold, 5=Silver. Always use `Sort` for ordering tiers. Filtering `PlayerLevelID > 3` does NOT mean "higher than Gold".
- **Internal tier (ID=4)**: Must be excluded in most customer analytics: `WHERE PlayerLevelID <> 4` or `WHERE PlayerLevelID NOT IN (0, 4)`.
- **-1 in range columns means disabled**: For Platinum/Platinum Plus/Diamond, FromSumLotCount=-1 and ToSumLotCount=-1 indicate the legacy lot-count threshold is not used. Do NOT interpret -1 as a valid lot count.
- **Critical columns missing from DWH**: `RealizedEquityFrom`, `RealizedEquityTo`, `DaysInRiskBeforeDowngrade`, `ThresholdPercentToCurrentLevel`, and `IsWalletRedeemAllowed` are ALL in production but NOT in DWH. For equity-tier evaluation, use the upstream source.
- **HEAP index**: Unlike most DWH Dim_ tables, this uses HEAP (no CCI). Row order is not guaranteed without explicit ORDER BY.
- **ID=0 midnight timestamp**: The N/A placeholder (ID=0) has midnight InsertDate/UpdateDate from `@ddate = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)`, while production rows have full timestamps from GETDATE().

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_Regulation defines the 15 regulatory jurisdictions under which eToro operates globally. Each regulation represents a financial authority (CySEC, FCA, ASIC, FinCEN, etc.) and maps to an eToro legal entity holding the corresponding license. This classification drives multi-jurisdiction compliance - it determines which rules apply to each customer, what instruments they can trade, what leverage limits are enforced, and how their funds are segregated. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, Dictionary.Regulation)

RegulationID is one of the most frequently joined columns in the DWH. It is assigned to users at registration (CustomerStatic.RegulationID) and propagated through every subsequent operation - deposits, trading, copy-trading, and compliance reporting. V_Dim_Customer joins Dim_Regulation to resolve the regulation name for every customer.

**DWH vs Production differences**: The DWH strips 6 columns from production (IsUSA, JurisdictionName, BankID, RegulationLongName, RegulationShortName, DefaultRegulationID) and adds 3 DWH-specific columns (DWHRegulationID = ID alias, StatusID = hardcoded 1, ClusterRegulationID = grouping logic). Analysts needing US/non-US split or jurisdiction names should reference the upstream wiki or query production via the Bronze layer.

Loaded daily by SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse via TRUNCATE+INSERT from DWH_staging.etoro_Dictionary_Regulation. All 15 rows have StatusID=1 (Active). No sentinel row.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 ClusterRegulationID Grouping

**What**: The ETL groups certain regulations into a single cluster (ID=1) for analytics aggregation.

**Columns Involved**: `ClusterRegulationID`, `ID`

**Rules**:
- IDs 0 (None), 1 (CySEC), 5 (BVI) -> ClusterRegulationID=1 (grouped as "CySEC/BVI/None" cluster)
- All other IDs -> ClusterRegulationID = ID (each regulation is its own cluster)

**Rationale**: BVI (5) is the non-US fallback regulation for users in jurisdictions without a specific eToro entity. CySEC (1) is the primary EU regulation. None (0) is the sentinel for unassigned users. Grouping them under cluster 1 allows DWH analytics to treat these three as a single reporting unit.

```
ClusterRegulationID mapping:
  ID=0 (None)    -> Cluster 1
  ID=1 (CySEC)   -> Cluster 1
  ID=5 (BVI)     -> Cluster 1
  All others     -> Cluster = ID (FCA=2, NFA=3, ASIC=4, eToroUS=6, ...)
```

### 2.2 DWH Column Gaps vs Production

**What**: The DWH drops 6 production columns that are needed for full compliance analysis.

**Columns Dropped**:
- `IsUSA` - US/non-US jurisdiction flag (critical for instrument availability branching)
- `JurisdictionName` - eToro legal entity name (e.g., "eToro EU", "eToro UK")
- `BankID` - FK to Dictionary.Bank (custodian banking partner)
- `RegulationLongName` - Full formal name (e.g., "Cyprus Securities Exchange Commission")
- `RegulationShortName` - Abbreviated code for compact display
- `DefaultRegulationID` - Self-reference fallback (non-US->BVI, US->eToroUS)

**Impact**: DWH analytics that need US vs non-US split must either hardcode the IDs (6, 7, 8, 12, 14 are US) or join to the Bronze layer. See Section 3.4 Gotchas.

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with CLUSTERED INDEX on ID. With 15 rows, REPLICATE is optimal. Join on ID directly.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, the Gold export at `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_regulation` is Parquet. Read the entire table for any lookup.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resolve RegulationID to name in customer data | `LEFT JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_Regulation r ON r.ID = cs.RegulationID` |
| Group analytics by regulation cluster | `GROUP BY r.ClusterRegulationID` |
| US vs non-US split (without IsUSA) | `WHERE r.ID IN (6, 7, 8, 12, 14)` for US; else non-US |
| Full customer record with regulation | Use `DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer` (pre-joins Dim_Regulation) |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.CustomerStatic / V_Dim_Customer | ON r.ID = cs.RegulationID | Resolve regulation name per customer |
| DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer | Dim_Regulation already joined (INNER JOIN on RegulationID) | Use view instead of re-joining |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **IsUSA not in DWH**: Production Dictionary.Regulation.IsUSA (US=1, non-US=0) is dropped by ETL. DWH analysts must hardcode: US regulations = IDs 6, 7, 8, 12, 14.
- **DWHRegulationID = ID**: These two columns always have the same value. DWHRegulationID is an ETL alias and appears redundant. Prefer ID for joins.
- **StatusID always 1**: Hardcoded Active for all rows. Not a meaningful filter.
- **Cluster 1 includes 3 regulations**: ClusterRegulationID=1 covers None (0), CySEC (1), and BVI (5). Aggregating by ClusterRegulationID will merge these three.
- **V_Dim_Customer uses INNER JOIN**: V_Dim_Customer has `INNER JOIN Dim_Regulation ON ID = RegulationID`. Customers with NULL RegulationID would be excluded.
- **Production has 6 more columns**: If you need IsUSA, JurisdictionName, or DefaultRegulationID, use the Bronze/staging layer or etoro.Dictionary.Regulation directly.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_AccountType is the DWH version of etoro.Dictionary.AccountType. It classifies every eToro account into one of 18 categories based on ownership structure and operational purpose. This classification drives which platform features are available, what regulatory rules apply, how fees are calculated, and how accounts are monitored for compliance.

Source: etoro.Dictionary.AccountType on etoroDB-REAL. The production table is exported daily to Bronze/etoro/Dictionary/AccountType/ and staged into DWH_staging.etoro_Dictionary_AccountType. SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse loads from that staging table using a TRUNCATE + INSERT pattern.

The DWH table has 19 rows: IDs 0-18. ID=0 (N/A) is a DWH placeholder row from the production source itself (no separate placeholder insert in the SP). DWHAccountTypeID is set equal to AccountTypeID by the ETL and carries no additional information. StatusID is hardcoded to 1. UpdateDate and InsertDate are both set to GETDATE() at load time.

Account types are assigned at customer registration and stored in Customer.CustomerStatic. They are read across BackOffice, Trade, Hedge, Billing, and Compliance systems. The account type rarely changes after initial assignment.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Account Category Groups

**What**: Account types cluster into functional groups that determine system behavior, regulatory treatment, and fee structures.

**Columns Involved**: `AccountTypeID`, `Name`

**Rules**:
- Retail accounts (1=Private, 4=Joint, 14=SMSF, 16=Administrated): Standard users subject to full retail regulation
- Corporate accounts (2=Corporate, 15=Affiliate Corporate): Business entities with enhanced KYC and reporting
- Partner accounts (3=IB, 5=White Label, 6=Affiliate Private, 12=White List): Revenue-sharing arrangements with special fee/commission structures
- Internal accounts (7=Employee, 10=eToro Group, 11=News, 13=Analyst, 17=Funded Employee): eToro-operated accounts with enhanced compliance monitoring
- Managed accounts (8=Custodian, 9=Fund): Third-party managed accounts with fiduciary requirements
- 18=Trust: Registered after the upstream wiki was generated; classification consistent with retail/managed category
- AccountTypeID=0 (N/A): DWH placeholder for NULL-safe JOINs

**Value Map** (19 rows in DWH):

| AccountTypeID | Name | Category |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | N/A | DWH placeholder |
| 1 | Private | Retail |
| 2 | Corporate | Corporate |
| 3 | IB Account | Partner |
| 4 | Joint Account | Retail |
| 5 | White Label | Partner |
| 6 | Affiliate Private Account | Partner |
| 7 | Employee Account | Internal |
| 8 | Custodian | Managed |
| 9 | Fund | Managed |
| 10 | eToro Group Account | Internal |
| 11 | News | Internal |
| 12 | White List | Partner |
| 13 | Analyst | Internal |
| 14 | SMSF | Retail |
| 15 | Affiliate Corporate Account | Corporate |
| 16 | Administrated Account | Retail |
| 17 | Funded Employee Account | Internal |
| 18 | Trust | Retail/Managed |

### 2.2 Fund and Copy Trading Routing

**What**: AccountTypeID=9 (Fund) receives special handling in copy trading and fund management.

**Columns Involved**: `AccountTypeID`

**Rules**:
- AccountTypeID=9 (Fund) accounts have special copy-trading settlement restrictions
- Fund allocation procedures route based on account type
- Hedge procedures use account type to route to correct liquidity accounts

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE distributed with a HEAP index. REPLICATE is correct for a 19-row lookup -- every distribution node holds a local copy, eliminating data movement on JOINs with fact tables. HEAP is appropriate for a table this small with no range queries.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, no partitioning needed for a 19-row reference table. Expected as a MANAGED Delta table.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| All retail (Private) customers | JOIN Dim_Customer ON AccountTypeID, filter AccountTypeID = 1 |
| Fund accounts and their performance | JOIN fact tables on CID, filter AccountTypeID = 9 |
| Internal vs external account split | CASE WHEN AccountTypeID IN (7,10,11,13,17) THEN 'Internal' ELSE 'External' END |
| Resolve type ID to name | JOIN Dim_AccountType ON AccountTypeID |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON Dim_Customer.AccountTypeID = Dim_AccountType.AccountTypeID | Resolve account type for each customer |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **DWHAccountTypeID = AccountTypeID**: This column is always equal to AccountTypeID. It is an ETL artifact with no additional information -- do not use it as a join key when AccountTypeID is available.
- **Name, not AccountTypeName**: The DWH column is called `Name` (not `AccountTypeName` like the production source). When joining or comparing to upstream wikis, note the rename.
- **ID=0 from production source**: Unlike other DWH Dim_ tables, the ID=0 (N/A) placeholder row comes from the production Dictionary.AccountType table itself, not from an explicit DWH SP insert.
- **18=Trust not in upstream wiki**: Type 18 (Trust) appears in the DWH live data but was added after the upstream Dictionary.AccountType wiki was generated.
- **StatusID always 1**: Hardcoded by ETL convention, carries no business meaning.

## 1. Business Meaning

`Dim_Country` is one of the most heavily-referenced dimension tables in the DWH. It defines every country and territory the eToro platform recognizes (251 rows: 250 active countries + 1 "Not available" placeholder at CountryID=0). Each row provides geographic classification, regulatory risk attributes, marketing segmentation, and compliance data for users registered from that country.

When a customer registers, their CountryID determines: which regulatory entity governs them (via RegulationID), what AML/KYC scrutiny level applies (IsHighRiskCountry, RiskGroupID), what marketing desk handles them (Desk), and whether they can receive RAF bonuses (IsEligibleForRAFBonusCountry).

The ETL is multi-step: TRUNCATE+INSERT from etoro.Dictionary.Country (primary, joined to etoro.Dictionary.MarketingRegion for the Region label), then three UPDATE passes that patch in EU classification from Ext_Dim_Country, Desk/CFKey from Ext_Dim_Country_Region_Desk, and RegulationID from ComplianceStateDB.Compliance.RegulationCountry. Several columns present in the upstream Dictionary.Country source are dropped in DWH (IsSettlementRestricted, DefaultCurrencyID, LanguageID, IsActive, PhonePrefix, IsoCode).

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 High-Risk Country Flag (Computed)

**What**: IsHighRiskCountry is derived from RiskGroupID in the ETL, not passed through from source. AML-flagged countries trigger enhanced due diligence.

**Columns Involved**: `IsHighRiskCountry`, `RiskGroupID`

**Rules**:
- `CASE WHEN RiskGroupID IN (0, 4) THEN 0 ELSE 1 END` -> IsHighRiskCountry
- RiskGroupID=0 (None): 70 countries -> not high risk
- RiskGroupID=4 (Verified before deposit): 2 countries -> not high risk
- RiskGroupID=1 (High risk country): 100 countries -> high risk
- RiskGroupID=2 (High risk for new clients): 71 countries -> high risk
- RiskGroupID=3 (High risk FATF country): 8 countries -> high risk
- High-risk countries trigger enhanced document verification, manual review of first deposit, and reduced transaction monitoring thresholds

**Diagram**:
```
RiskGroupID -> IsHighRiskCountry
0 (None)                  -> 0  (70 countries)
4 (Verified bfr deposit)  -> 0  (2 countries)
1 (High risk)             -> 1  (100 countries)
2 (High risk new clients) -> 1  (71 countries)
3 (High risk FATF)        -> 1  (8 countries)
```

### 2.2 EU vs. European Country Classification

**What**: Two separate flags distinguish full EU membership from broader European geography.

**Columns Involved**: `EU`, `IsEuropeanCountry`

**Rules**:
- EU=1: 27 countries with full EU membership (legal/treaty member states)
- IsEuropeanCountry=1: 66 countries total (27 EU members + 39 other European countries)
- Source: Ext_Dim_Country (manual extension table), not from etoro.Dictionary.Country
- EU=1 always implies IsEuropeanCountry=1. IsEuropeanCountry=1 does NOT imply EU=1.

### 2.3 Region vs. MarketingRegion

**What**: DWH exposes two separate geographic segmentations. `Region` is marketing-driven; the source geographic `RegionID` is dropped.

**Columns Involved**: `Region`, `MarketingRegionID`, `MarketingRegionManualName`, `Desk`

**Rules**:
- `Region` is loaded from etoro.Dictionary.MarketingRegion.Name (y.Name AS Region in SP). It is the marketing region label.
- `MarketingRegionManualName` is a manual override from Ext_Dim_Country - may differ from Region (e.g., Albania: Region=ROE, MarketingRegionManualName=CEE).
- `Desk` is a sales/support desk assignment from Ext_Dim_Country_Region_Desk, joined via MarketingRegionID.
- The upstream Dictionary.Country source has a geographic `RegionID` pointing to Dictionary.Region - this is NOT loaded to DWH.
- 22 distinct Region values in DWH (South & Central America=40, Africa=38, ROW=38, French=23, etc.)

### 2.4 Dropped Source Columns (Compliance-Critical)

**What**: Several compliance and localization columns present in the upstream source are NOT loaded to DWH.

**Dropped from etoro.Dictionary.Country**:
- `IsSettlementRestricted`: 21 countries restricted to CFD-only trading (cannot hold REAL assets). Includes United States (SEC/FINRA). CRITICAL for compliance analysts.
- `DefaultCurrencyID`: Trading account default currency (USD/EUR/GBP/AUD/CAD/PLN).
- `LanguageID`: UI language default.
- `IsActive`: Whether country is active on platform.
- `PhonePrefix`: International dialing code.
- `IsoCode`: ISO 3166-1 numeric code.
- `RegionID`: Geographic region FK (DWH replaces with text Region label from MarketingRegion).

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE (correct for a 251-row dimension - broadcast to all nodes avoids data movement on JOINs). HEAP means no sorted index. The non-clustered PK on CountryID is NOT ENFORCED - duplicates are theoretically possible but prevented by ETL TRUNCATE.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, store as Delta (MANAGED), no partitioning needed (251 rows). Z-ORDER on CountryID optional for join optimization.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Decode country for a customer | `JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_Country d ON f.CountryID = d.CountryID` |
| Filter high-risk countries | `WHERE d.IsHighRiskCountry = 1` |
| Filter EU customers | `WHERE d.EU = 1` |
| Group by marketing region | `GROUP BY d.Region` |
| Find regulation for a country | `SELECT RegulationID FROM Dim_Country WHERE CountryID = @id` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON c.CountryID = d.CountryID | Decode customer country attributes |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_BillingDeposit | ON f.CountryID = d.CountryID | Country-level deposit analytics |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_CountryBin | ON c.CountryID = d.CountryID | BIN-to-country card mapping |
| DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer | ON v.CountryID = d.CountryID | Customer view with country decode |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- CountryID=0 ("Not available") is a real row - use `WHERE CountryID > 0` to exclude the placeholder in population-level queries.
- `IsHighRiskCountry` is RECOMPUTED from `RiskGroupID` by the ETL (not passthrough from source). If source IsHighRiskCountry changes but RiskGroupID stays the same, DWH will not reflect the change.
- `IsSettlementRestricted` is NOT in DWH. This critical compliance flag must be looked up in the source etoro.Dictionary.Country if needed.
- `Region` reflects `MarketingRegion.Name`, not the geographic `Dictionary.Region`. The two segmentations differ (e.g., Albania: geographic region=Europe, marketing Region=ROE).
- `DWHCountryID` always equals `CountryID` (redundant copy from SP: `x.CountryID AS DWHCountryID`). Never use both in GROUP BY.
- `StatusID` is hardcoded to 1 for all rows (including CountryID=0). No meaningful variation.
- `InsertDate` and `UpdateDate` are both set to GETDATE() on each daily reload - they reflect ETL run time, not original insert or data change time.

## 1. Business Meaning

`Dim_GuruStatus` is a 9-row dictionary classifying eToro customers in the **Popular Investor (PI) program** (internally called "Guru"). The PI program allows experienced traders to earn income by being copied; status reflects their tier and program standing.

The status ladder (active tiers):
- 0 = No: Customer is not enrolled in the Popular Investor program
- 1 = Certified: Entry-level PI certification
- 2 = Cadet: First active tier of the PI program
- 3 = Rising Star: Second tier - growing following
- 4 = Champion: Third tier
- 5 = Elite: Fourth tier - top performers
- 6 = Elite Pro: Highest active tier - professional Popular Investors

Negative states:
- 7 = Removed: Previously enrolled, now removed from the program
- 8 = Rejected: Applied but rejected from the program

**GuruStatusID=0 (No)** serves as both the "not enrolled" value and the null-safe join sentinel: SP_Dim_Customer uses `ISNULL(GuruStatusID, 0)` to coerce NULLs to 0.

The data originates from `etoro.Dictionary.GuruStatus` via `DWH_staging.etoro_Dictionary_GuruStatus`. ETL: TRUNCATE + INSERT, `Name` renamed to `GuruStatusName`.

Consumers: `Dim_Customer` (each customer's current PI status), `Fact_SnapshotCustomer` (daily PI status snapshot), `Fact_CustomerAction_DL_To_Synapse` (PI status at action time).

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Popular Investor Tier Ladder

**What**: Active PI statuses represent a progression from entry-level to elite.

**Columns Involved**: `GuruStatusID`, `GuruStatusName`

**Rules**:
```
Tier progression (active):
  No (0) -> Certified (1) -> Cadet (2) -> Rising Star (3)
         -> Champion (4) -> Elite (5) -> Elite Pro (6)

Negative states (off-ladder):
  Removed (7): was in program, exited
  Rejected (8): applied, not accepted
```

**For analysis**: GuruStatusID > 0 AND < 7 = currently active in PI program. GuruStatusID = 0 = regular customer.

### 2.2 Null-Sentinel Pattern

**What**: GuruStatusID=0 (No) absorbs NULL values from Dim_Customer.

**Columns Involved**: `GuruStatusID`

**Rules**:
- SP_Dim_Customer: `ISNULL(GuruStatusID, 0) AS GuruStatusID` (customers with no PI enrollment get ID 0)
- SP_Dim_Customer change detection: `OR ISNULL(dc.GuruStatusID, 0) <> ISNULL(a.GuruStatusID, 0)`
- Meaning: NULL and 0 are semantically equivalent (not in PI program)

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, REPLICATE-distributed (9 rows - appropriate). CLUSTERED INDEX on GuruStatusID. No data movement on joins.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, 9 rows - no partitioning needed. Broadcast join automatic.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Decode GuruStatusID to name | `LEFT JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_GuruStatus ON GuruStatusID` |
| Find active Popular Investors | `WHERE GuruStatusID BETWEEN 1 AND 6` |
| Exclude regular customers | `WHERE GuruStatusID > 0 AND GuruStatusID < 7` |
| Count customers by PI tier | `GROUP BY GuruStatusName ORDER BY GuruStatusID` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON GuruStatusID | Customer's current Popular Investor status |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer | ON GuruStatusID | Daily PI status snapshot per customer |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_CustomerAction | ON GuruStatusID | PI status at time of action |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **ID=0 is NOT null**: GuruStatusID=0 means "No" (not in PI program). It is the semantic null sentinel. Do not filter it out when showing all customers - it represents the majority.
- **Active PI filter**: To find active Popular Investors, use `GuruStatusID BETWEEN 1 AND 6`. IDs 7 (Removed) and 8 (Rejected) are ex-PI or rejected applicants and should be excluded from "active PI" counts.
- **Tiers imply rank**: GuruStatusID 1-6 form a meaningful rank ordering (lower = less established). Use ORDER BY GuruStatusID for tier comparisons.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_Range is a DWH-internal helper lookup that pre-computes all possible (FromDate, ToDate) date range pairs needed by the Snapshot analytics pipelines. Each row represents a unique start-to-end date interval, identified by a composite BigInt key (DateRangeID). The table enables efficient range-based JOINs in SnapshotEquity and SnapshotCustomer views without requiring date arithmetic at query time.

This table has no external production source. It is generated entirely within the DWH by SP_Fact_SnapshotEquity and SP_Fact_SnapshotCustomer, which INSERT new DateRangeID combinations as they encounter new date pairs during snapshot processing. The pattern is append-only - new rows are added daily but existing rows are never updated or deleted.

As of 2026-03-10, the table contains approximately 1.3 million date range pairs spanning from 2007-01-01 to 2026-03-10 on the FromDate side, and 2007-08-26 to 2026-12-31 on the ToDate side.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 DateRangeID Encoding

**What**: DateRangeID is a deterministic composite key encoding both FromDate and MMDD(ToDate) into a single 12-digit BigInt.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `FromDateID`, `ToDateID`

**Rules**:
- Formula: `DateRangeID = CONCAT(YYYYMMDD(FromDate), MMDD(ToDate))`
- Example: FromDateID=20070101, ToDateID=20071231 -> DateRangeID=200701011231
- Decoding FromDateID: `CONVERT(INT, LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 8))`
- Decoding ToDateID: `CONVERT(INT, LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4) + RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4))`
- The YEAR component of ToDateID is always the SAME as the YEAR of FromDateID (only MMDD of ToDate is stored in the last 4 digits)

**Diagram**:
```
DateRangeID (12-digit BigInt):
  [ YYYY | MM | DD | MM | DD ]
  [  From Year  | From MMDD  | To MMDD ]
   |___________|             |________|
   Chars 1-8 = FromDateID    Chars 9-12 = MMDD(ToDate)

  ToDateID = YYYY(FromDate) + MMDD(ToDate)
  -> Year-end range example:
     FromDate=2020-03-15, ToDate=2020-12-31
     DateRangeID = 202003151231
     ToDateID    = 20201231
```

### 2.2 Snapshot Range Pattern

**What**: Dim_Range is the bridge between individual customer dates and fiscal/calendar year-end periods in Snapshot reports.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `FromDateID`, `ToDateID`

**Rules**:
- The primary use case is "from customer registration/event date to year-end": FromDate = customer's start date, ToDate = December 31 of that year
- The SPs also generate non-year-end ranges when snapshots require partial-period measurements
- The table grows daily as new snapshot dates are processed
- No deduplication needed - DateRangeID uniqueness is enforced by the NOT EXISTS check in both SPs

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with a composite CLUSTERED INDEX on (DateRangeID, FromDateID, ToDateID) and three Non-Clustered Indexes: IX_Dim_Range_FromDateID, IX_Dim_Range_ToDateID, and IX_Dim_Range_FromDateID_ToDateID. The NCI indexes are unusual for Synapse (which typically uses only CCI) and suggest heavy range-based lookups by the Snapshot SPs. Always filter on FromDateID or ToDateID directly to leverage these indexes.

Note: PRIMARY KEY (DateRangeID) is declared NOT ENFORCED - Synapse does not validate uniqueness but the ETL SPs maintain it via NOT EXISTS guards.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, the Gold export at `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_range` is Parquet. With 1.3M rows, consider filtering on FromDateID for performance.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Find the DateRangeID for a specific (from, to) pair | `SELECT DateRangeID FROM DWH_dbo.Dim_Range WHERE FromDateID = @from AND ToDateID = @to` |
| Find all ranges starting from a given date | `WHERE FromDateID = @date` (uses IX_Dim_Range_FromDateID) |
| Look up range details from a DateRangeID | `SELECT FromDateID, ToDateID FROM DWH_dbo.Dim_Range WHERE DateRangeID = @id` |
| Check how many ranges exist for a year | `WHERE FromDateID BETWEEN @year*10000+101 AND @year*10000+1231` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotEquity | DateRangeID | Resolve snapshot equity date ranges |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer | DateRangeID | Resolve snapshot customer date ranges |
| DWH_dbo.V_Fact_SnapshotEquity | DateRangeID | View-level access to snapshot equity with resolved ranges |
| DWH_dbo.V_M2M_Date_DateRange | DateRangeID | Month-to-month date range bridging |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **ToDate YEAR = FromDate YEAR**: The DateRangeID encoding only stores MMDD of ToDate. The year of ToDate is derived from FromDate's year. This means all ranges in this table are within-year ranges - cross-year ranges cannot be represented.
- **INSERT-only, no TRUNCATE**: Both writer SPs use NOT EXISTS guards, making the table append-only. Rows are never deleted. If a DateRangeID is erroneously created, it persists forever.
- **Primary key NOT ENFORCED**: Synapse does not verify uniqueness of DateRangeID. Trust the ETL logic, not the constraint.
- **DateRangeID is a STRING-derived number**: Always treat DateRangeID as a derived key, not a business ID. Decode using LEFT/RIGHT string operations if needed.
- **1.3M rows for a dim table**: Larger than typical dimensions. REPLICATE is appropriate given daily Snapshot SP joins from all distributions.
