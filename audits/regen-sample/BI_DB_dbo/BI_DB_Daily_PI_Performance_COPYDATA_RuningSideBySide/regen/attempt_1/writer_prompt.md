# Regen Harness — Writer Prompt

# Regen Harness — Writer (single-object mode)

You are running the DWH Semantic Documentation pipeline on **ONE OBJECT** in
isolated regen-harness mode. This is NOT the normal batch loop. You are NOT
reading `_index.md`, NOT updating any index file, NOT processing other
objects, NOT running cross-schema sync. You document one object end-to-end and
exit.

---

## ⛔ MCP PRE-FLIGHT — MANDATORY

Before reading any rule files or DDL:

1. Call `mcp__synapse_sql__execute_sql_read_only` with `SELECT 1 AS mcp_preflight`.
2. **If it fails or the tool does not exist**: print `REGEN ABORT: Synapse MCP unavailable` and **EXIT IMMEDIATELY**. A wiki without live data sampling is INCOMPLETE and WILL FAIL the adversarial judge.
3. **If it succeeds**: print `MCP PRE-FLIGHT: PASS` and continue.

No exceptions. No "code-only documentation" fallback. No "I'll skip Phase 2 because the table looks dormant" — the judge sees the dormant footer too and will fail you for missing data evidence.

---

## ⛔ REGEN-HARNESS BREVITY OVERRIDE

This is a regen-harness run; we are optimising for token efficiency. The judge's
HARD assertions (8 sections present; ETL diagram in 5.2; Element table shape; row
count = DDL column count; Tier suffix on every Element row) all REMAIN MANDATORY.
Soft prose around them is CAPPED — defer to these caps even when the
GOLDEN-REFERENCE example (Dim_Mirror) shows verbose prose.

| Section | Cap |
|---|---|
| 1. Business Meaning | <=120 words. One paragraph. Must include row count, date range, ETL SP, source. |
| 2. Business Logic | <=2 subsections; each <=80 words What/Columns/Rules. Skip section entirely if no non-trivial logic. |
| 3.1 Distribution & Index | <=2 sentences. |
| 3.2 Common Query Patterns | Table only, max 3 rows, no commentary. |
| 3.3 Common JOINs | Table only, max 3 rows, no commentary. |
| 3.4 Gotchas | <=4 bullets, one line each. |
| 4. Elements | Each row Description: ONE sentence ending `(Tier N — source)`. No multi-sentence per-column descriptions. Inline dictionary values when <=15 distinct (per GOLDEN-REFERENCE Section C). |
| 5.2 ETL Pipeline | Diagram + 1 sentence below. No additional prose. |
| 6. Relationships | Tables only, no prose around them. |
| 7. Sample Queries | EXACTLY 2 queries. One sentence header each, no explanation paragraph. |
| 8. Atlassian Knowledge | Bullets only. |

These caps cut output from ~22K tokens to ~10K tokens per object. Keep the
information density HIGH, drop the explanation/narrative prose. The wiki is for
analysts and AI agents who already know the domain — they do not need essay-style
context.

---

## ⛔ PHASE 3 DISTRIBUTION CAP

Phase 3 (distribution analysis) is capped at **at most 3 categorical columns**
per object. Pick those whose names match the regex
`Status|Type|Code|Country|Region|Currency|Category|Reg|Score|Group|Kind|Class`.
Skip free-text columns entirely (Email, Description, Comment, Note, Address,
Name, Url, Subject, Body, Reason).

If fewer than 3 columns match the regex, run distribution queries on however
many DO match — running zero distribution queries is OK if the table has no
obviously-categorical columns.

---

## ⛔ OUTPUT DIRECTORY GUARANTEE

The directory listed under **Absolute output directory** in the Object Header
ALREADY EXISTS, was created by the harness, and is empty (apart from the
writer_prompt.md you are reading). DO NOT run `Bash ls` to check it. DO NOT
run `Bash mkdir`. Just call `Write` directly with the absolute paths from the
Object Header for the three required files.

---

## ⛔ PRE-RESOLVED UPSTREAM CONTEXT — your Tier 1 inheritance source is below, USE IT

The block titled **"## PRE-RESOLVED UPSTREAM BUNDLE"** in this prompt was
assembled **deterministically by the harness, before you started**. It contains:

- The **DDL** for the object you are documenting (verbatim from SSDT).
- Every **upstream wiki** the harness could resolve from the existing
  `.lineage.md` plus DDL-derived references — both local Synapse wikis and
  remote production-DB wikis (DB_Schema, ExperianceDBs, etc.).
- For any stored procedure mentioned in the lineage, the **SP source code**
  pulled from `DataPlatform\SynapseSQLPool1\sql_dp_prod_we\...`.

**Treat this bundle as your AUTHORITATIVE source for Tier 1 inheritance.** You
are NOT permitted to claim "no upstream wiki could be found" if the bundle
contains one. You ARE permitted to read additional files via the `Read` tool
if you need more context.

### Tier rules — re-stated, NON-NEGOTIABLE

For every column in the object:

1. **Passthrough or rename WITH upstream wiki present in the bundle** →
   **Tier 1**. Description MUST be a verbatim quote from the upstream wiki.
   Do not paraphrase. Do not "improve". Do not generalize vendor names. Do not
   drop NULL semantics. The judge will run a character-by-character
   comparison.
2. **ETL-computed** (CASE / arithmetic / aggregation visible in the SP source) →
   **Tier 2** with the transform stated.
3. **Dim-lookup passthrough** (`SELECT dim.X` with no transform AND `Dim_X`
   has its own Tier 1 origin documented in the bundle) → **Tier 1 with the
   dim's origin** (e.g. `Dictionary.Country`), NOT `Tier 2 via SP_X` and NOT
   `Tier 1 via Dim_X` (Dim_X is a relay, not a root). Quote the dim's wiki
   verbatim.
4. **No source traceable from bundle, DDL, JOINs, or SP source** →
   **Tier 3** with explicit reason. Be specific: "PII column, no upstream wiki
   located, name suggests …".
5. **`Tier 4 — inferred from name`** is BANNED unless the bundle explicitly
   shows the column has no upstream and no SP code touches it. Lazy Tier 4 is
   the #1 reason wikis fail the judge. If you are tempted to write Tier 4
   with no other evidence, you have skipped Phase 9 — go back and read the
   SP source in the bundle.

### Footer rules

- If the bundle contains AT LEAST ONE upstream wiki: the footer MUST identify
  the production source(s). Writing `Production Source: Unknown (dormant)`
  when the bundle proves an upstream exists is an automatic fail.
- If `_no_upstream_found.txt` exists in the regen folder: it is OK to mark
  the table as dormant in the footer, but you MUST still ground every column
  description in the DDL + SP code rather than `Tier 4 — inferred`.

---

## Output paths — write here, NOT into the main wiki tree

Write all THREE output files into:

```
audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/
  {Object}.md
  {Object}.lineage.md
  {Object}.review-needed.md
```

`{Schema}`, `{Object}`, and `{N}` are passed in via the prompt header below.

**DO NOT** write into `knowledge/synapse/Wiki/` under any circumstances. The
main tree is read-only for this run. **DO NOT** modify `_index.md` or any
`_batch_context.json`. **DO NOT** generate `.alter.sql`. **DO NOT** run Phase
16 — the adversarial judge runs as a separate, fresh claude process AFTER you
exit. Pretending to evaluate yourself wastes tokens.

---

## Pipeline scope for this single object

Run phases 1 through 11 inclusive. Skip Phase 16. Skip Phase 11W (no ALTER).
Skip cross-object index updates. Skip `_batch_context.json` writes.

Required phase gates (you must print them as you complete each):

```
PHASE GATE — {Schema}.{Object}:
  [x] P1 DDL          [x] P2 Sample        [x] P3 Dist
  [x] P4 Lookup       [x] P5 JOIN          [x] P6 BizLogic
  [x] P7 Views        [x] P8 SP-scan       [x] P9 SP-logic
  [x] P9B ETL         [x] P10 Jira         [x] P10A Upstream
  [x] P10B Lineage    → Ready for P11
```

If a phase truly cannot run (e.g. no SPs reference the table), mark it `[-]`
with a one-line reason. Skipping P2 or P3 because "the table is small" is
NOT a valid reason — sample it.

---

## Outputs — three files, exact shape

Follow the GOLDEN-REFERENCE in
`.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/GOLDEN-REFERENCE.mdc`.

1. **`{Object}.lineage.md`** — written FIRST (Phase 10B). Source Objects
   table + Column Lineage table. Every Tier 1 row must point to a file in the
   pre-resolved bundle (or to a wiki you read independently).
2. **`{Object}.md`** — the main wiki, 8 sections, every column in
   Section 4's Elements table, every description ending with
   `(Tier N — source)`.
3. **`{Object}.review-needed.md`** — items needing human review. MUST NOT
   contain a `## 4. Elements` section.

---

## Final checklist before exiting

Print, verbatim:

```
OUTPUT CHECK — {Schema}.{Object}:
  [x] .lineage.md    written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.lineage.md
  [x] .md            written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.md
  [x] .review-needed.md written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.review-needed.md
  [-] .alter.sql     deferred (regen harness — judge runs next)
  Tier1 columns: N    Tier2: N    Tier3: N    Tier4: N
  Bundle inheritance used: YES/NO  (NO is only valid if `_no_upstream_found.txt` exists)
```

Then EXIT. Do not run a self-evaluation. Do not "double-check by re-reading
the wiki you just wrote". Do not append a verdict block. The judge runs in a
separate process with its own context.

# build-wiki-bidb-batch

You are running the DWH Semantic Documentation pipeline for schema BI_DB_dbo.
**Wiki-only mode** — generate documentation files only. ALTER scripts are generated separately later via `/generate-alter-dwh`.

## ⛔ MCP PRE-FLIGHT — NON-NEGOTIABLE, CHECK BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

Before loading rules, before reading the index, before planning anything:

1. **Test Synapse MCP**: Call `mcp__synapse_sql__execute_sql_read_only` with `SELECT 1 AS mcp_preflight`
2. **If it fails or the tool does not exist**: Print `BATCH ABORT: Synapse MCP unavailable` and **EXIT IMMEDIATELY**. Do NOT proceed. Do NOT fall back to "prior batch context data". Do NOT use a "schema practice" of skipping MCP. A wiki without live data sampling is INCOMPLETE and WILL NOT PASS the adversarial evaluator. STOP HERE.
3. **If it succeeds**: Print `MCP PRE-FLIGHT: PASS` and continue to Instructions.

There is NO exception to this rule. No "prior context", no "code-only documentation", no "graceful degradation". MCP down = batch aborted. Period.

---

## Instructions (regen-harness, single object)

1. **Load rules** — read these in order before anything else:
   - `.cursor/rules/semantic-layer-core/repo-first-access.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/00-execution-card.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/mcp-query-rules.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/GOLDEN-REFERENCE.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/10.5b-tier1-enforcement.mdc`

2. **Skip batch planning** — do NOT read `_index.md`, do NOT touch
   `_batch_context.json`, do NOT scan the blacklist. The harness
   already chose this object.

3. **Run the pipeline for THIS object only**: phases 1 through 11
   inclusive. Use the pre-resolved upstream bundle (provided below)
   as your authoritative Tier 1 source. Generate three files in
   `audits/regen-sample/{schema}/{object}/regen/attempt_{N}/`:
   `.lineage.md`, `.md`, `.review-needed.md`. Do NOT generate
   `.alter.sql`. Do NOT modify any file under `knowledge/synapse/Wiki/`.

4. **Skip Phase 16** — the adversarial judge runs in a separate,
   fresh claude process after you exit. Self-evaluation here wastes
   tokens and pollutes the comparison.

5. **Exit cleanly** after printing the OUTPUT CHECK block defined in
   the Regen Harness preamble.

## Key resources

## Upstream Wikis Found

Found 7 upstream wiki(s). Read EACH one in full.


### Upstream `BI_DB_dbo.BI_DB_PositionPnL` — synapse
- **Resolved as**: `BI_DB_dbo.BI_DB_PositionPnL`
- **Wiki path**: `C:\Users\guyman\Documents\github\Databricks_Knowledge\knowledge\synapse\Wiki\BI_DB_dbo\Tables\BI_DB_PositionPnL.md`

# BI_DB_dbo.BI_DB_PositionPnL

## 1. Overview

Daily end-of-day snapshot of **open trading positions** with unrealized P&L, rates, commissions, NOP, and close-price metrics. Grain is **one row per position per calendar day** (`DateID` + `PositionID`); only positions open as of end of `@dt` appear for that `DateID`.

## 2. Business Context

- **Rules**: Positions are sourced from `DWH_dbo.Dim_Position` with `OpenDateID < @ReportDateID` and still open on `@dt` (`CloseDateID >= @ReportDateID` or `CloseDateID = 0`). `Dim_PositionChangeLog` rewinds `Amount`, `StopRate`, `AmountInUnitsDecimal`, and `IsSettled` when changes occur after `@dt`; rows with partial-close child (`ChangeTypeID = 11`) after `@dt` are removed. Stock splits adjust `InitForexRate`, units, and EOD rates via `Dim_HistorySplitRatio` and `#Prices`. **PositionPnL** is `PnLInDollars` from Dim_Position (authoritative PnL engine) since 2024-03-24; **Price** and **NOP** still use SP formulas from EOD rates and `Dim_Instrument` FX chains. **DailyPnL** is updated after load as today `PositionPnL` minus prior day `PositionPnL` per `PositionID`.
- **Consumers**: Finance and CMR reporting; downstream BI_DB procedures and views (e.g. crypto zero / loan / NOP stacks, IFRS, compliance, dashboards) read this table as the canonical daily position P&L snapshot.

## 3. Structure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Schema** | BI_DB_dbo |
| **Object type** | Table |
| **Column count** | 39 |
| **Distribution** | `HASH (PositionID)` |
| **Clustered index** | `(DateID ASC, Date ASC, CID ASC, PositionID ASC)` |
| **Partitioning** | `PARTITION (DateID RANGE LEFT FOR VALUES (...))` -- daily boundaries aligned with main table (typically 2015 through current horizon) |
| **Nonclustered index** | `IX_BI_DB_PositionPnL_CID` on `(DateID, CID)` on main table (per deployment; switch staging builds CID NCIs on switch tables) |

## 5. Relationships

**Source tables (ETL read path)**

| Source | Role |
|--------|------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Position | Open positions, PnL dollars, fees, close/current rates, core attributes |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_CurrencyPriceWithSplit | Latest bid/ask before `@ReportDate` per instrument |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_HistorySplitRatio | Split boundaries and ratios for rate/unit adjustment |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_PositionChangeLog | Rewind deletes/updates for post-`@dt` changes |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Instrument (+ self-joins / #Prices) | Instrument currency pair and USD cross for Price and NOP |

**Consumers (representative)**

Includes finance and CMR pipelines and many BI_DB dependents such as **`BI_DB_Crypto_Zero`**, **`BI_DB_Real_Crypto_Loan`**, **`BI_DB_DailyZero_TreeSize_NEW`** (and related daily zero / NOP procedures), plus roll-over and dividend logic (**`SP_RollOverFee_Dividends`** reads prior-day `AmountInUnitsDecimal`), IFRS, compliance, and diagnostics. Confirm additional references with a repo search on `BI_DB_PositionPnL`.

## 6. ETL & Lifecycle

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Writer** | `BI_DB_dbo.SP_PositionPnL` @dt |
| **OpsDB** | Priority **99**, ProcessType **4** (FinanceReportSPS), frequency **Daily** |
| **Pattern** | Build `#UnrealizedPnL` -- create `BI_DB_PositionPnL_SWITCH_SINGLE` with same distribution/index/partition scheme as main table -- `INSERT ... SELECT` from `#UnrealizedPnL` -- `SP_BI_DB_PositionPnL_SWITCH` partition swap -- `UPDATE` **DailyPnL** vs previous `DateID` |
| **Grain** | One row per open `PositionID` per `DateID` |
| **Delete scope** | Daily partition replaced via switch for the target `DateID` (not a full-table DELETE) |

## 7. Query Advisory

- **Partition elimination**: Always filter **`WHERE DateID = ...` or a tight `DateID` range**; scanning all daily partitions is prohibitively expensive.
- **Distribution**: **`PositionID`** is the hash key -- joins and GROUP BY on `PositionID` minimize movement; filtering large sets by `CID` alone may benefit from **`IX_BI_DB_PositionPnL_CID (DateID, CID)`** when present.
- **Semantics**: Table holds **open** positions only for each snapshot date; closed-position economics live in `Dim_Position` / fact tables.
- **DailyPnL**: Populated in a second step; for intraday copies of switch tables, expect NULL until the main-table UPDATE runs.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_Instrument is the master instrument dimension for the DWH, containing 15,707 rows representing every tradeable instrument on the eToro platform. It covers Stocks (12,849), ETFs (1,287), Crypto Currencies (667), Commodities (503), Indices (247), and Currencies/Forex (153), plus one sentinel row (InstrumentID=0, 'NA').

The table is populated by `DWH_dbo.SP_Dim_Instrument`, which performs a full truncate-and-reload on each run. The SP joins the staging replica of the production `Trade.GetInstrument` view with `Dictionary.Currency` (for buy/sell abbreviations), `Trade.InstrumentMetaData` (display names, symbols, exchange, ISIN, industry), `Trade.ProviderToInstrument` (precision, allow flags, bonus credit, provider margin), `Trade.InstrumentCusip` (CUSIP identifiers), `Trade.FuturesMetaData` (multiplier, settlement time), `Trade.FuturesInstrumentsInitialMarginByProviderMapping` (provider margin per lot), and `Trade.Instrument` (OperationMode).

After the initial INSERT, the SP performs post-insert UPDATEs to enrich rows with: ReceivedOnPriceServer (from PriceLog history), AssetClass/IndustryGroup (from a static classification table), ADV_Last3Months/MKTcap/SharesOutStanding (from Rankings.StockInfo.InstrumentData), and PlatformSector/PlatformIndustry (from Rankings platform metadata). Finally, a sentinel row (InstrumentID=0) is inserted with 'NA' placeholder values, and `SP_Dim_Instrument_Snapshot` is called for date-partitioned snapshots.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 InstrumentType CASE Mapping

**What**: Translates numeric InstrumentTypeID into human-readable asset class labels.

**Columns Involved**: `InstrumentTypeID`, `InstrumentType`

**Rules**:
- 1 = Currencies (153 instruments)
- 2 = Commodities (503)
- 4 = Indices (247)
- 5 = Stocks (12,849)
- 6 = ETF (1,287)
- 10 = Crypto Currencies (667)
- All others = Other

### 2.2 IsMajor Flag Mapping

**What**: Converts the production bit flag IsMajor (0/1) into a Yes/No string.

**Columns Involved**: `IsMajorID`, `IsMajor`

**Rules**:
- IsMajorID stores the raw bit value from Trade.GetInstrument.IsMajor
- IsMajor = 'Yes' when IsMajorID = 1, 'No' otherwise
- Yes: 6,963 instruments; No: 8,743; NA: 1 (sentinel)

### 2.3 IsFuture Derivation from InstrumentGroups

**What**: Determines whether an instrument is a futures contract based on membership in GroupID=25 in Trade.InstrumentGroups.

**Columns Involved**: `IsFuture`

**Rules**:
- 1 if InstrumentID exists in Trade.InstrumentGroups WHERE GroupID=25
- 0 otherwise
- 243 instruments flagged as futures; 15,463 non-futures

### 2.4 Post-Insert Market Data Enrichment

**What**: After the main INSERT, the SP updates financial metrics from Rankings.StockInfo data.

**Columns Involved**: `ADV_Last3Months`, `MKTcap`, `SharesOutStanding`, `PlatformSector`, `PlatformIndustry`

**Rules**:
- ADV_Last3Months from MetadataID=8557 (KeyName='AverageDailyVolumeLast3Months-TTM')
- MKTcap = ISNULL(MarketCapitalization-TTM, CryptoMarketCap) — falls back to crypto market cap
- SharesOutStanding from MetadataID=8444 (KeyName='SharesOutstandingCurrent-Annual')
- PlatformSector from MetadataID=8436 (StrVal, pivoted)
- PlatformIndustry from MetadataID=8280 (StrVal, pivoted)

### 2.5 Sentinel Row

**What**: A placeholder row with InstrumentID=0 is inserted at the end of the SP for FK safety.

**Columns Involved**: All

**Rules**:
- InstrumentID=0, InstrumentTypeID=0, InstrumentType='NA', Name='NA'
- Most nullable columns set to NULL
- StatusID=NULL (vs 1 for data rows)

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

REPLICATE distribution means the full table is copied to every compute node — ideal for a 15K-row dimension used in JOINs with large fact tables. CLUSTERED INDEX on InstrumentID supports point lookups and range scans. No distribution key to worry about for colocation.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Look up an instrument by ID | `WHERE InstrumentID = @id` — clustered index seek |
| Filter by asset class | `WHERE InstrumentType = 'Stocks'` or `WHERE InstrumentTypeID = 5` |
| Find tradeable instruments | `WHERE Tradable = 1` |
| Futures only | `WHERE IsFuture = 1` |
| Search by symbol | `WHERE Symbol = 'AAPL'` or `WHERE SymbolFull = 'AAPL'` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Fact tables (positions, orders) | `ON f.InstrumentID = di.InstrumentID` | Resolve instrument name, type, exchange |
| Dim_Customer | Via fact table bridge | Instrument exposure per customer |
| Fact_CurrencyPriceWithSplit | `ON f.InstrumentID = di.InstrumentID` | Price data with instrument metadata |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **InstrumentID=0 is a sentinel** — exclude it with `WHERE InstrumentID > 0` in aggregations
- **IsMajor is a varchar 'Yes'/'No'**, not a bit — use IsMajorID (int) for numeric filters
- **InstrumentType 'NA'** only appears on the sentinel row
- **Multiplier is NULL** for 15,464 of 15,707 rows — only populated for futures instruments
- **AssetClass is NULL** for 13,557 rows — only populated from the static classification table
- **OperationMode is NULL** for sentinel row only; 0=Standard (13,140), 1=Alternate (2,566, primarily European stock CFDs)

## 1. Business Meaning

`V_Liabilities` is the platform's primary view for computing what eToro owes each customer (liabilities) and how much of the customer's balance is "real" vs promotional credit.

**Core formula** — let `NetEquity = TotalPositionsAmount + TotalCash + TotalStockOrders + PositionPnL`:
- **ActualNWA** (Non-Withdrawable Amount): The portion of NetEquity covered by BonusCredit. Clamped to `[0, BonusCredit]`. If the customer's NetEquity exceeds their BonusCredit, ActualNWA = BonusCredit. If NetEquity goes negative, ActualNWA = 0.
- **Liabilities**: InProcessCashouts + the portion of NetEquity **above** BonusCredit. This is what eToro owes the customer — real money, not promotional credit.
- **Balance**: Liabilities + ActualNWA = RealizedEquity + PositionPnL (Confluence: "Summary of V-Liabilities")

**Business context** (from Confluence):
- "If clients lose money, their Actual NWA will reflect only what's left. A client has $1000, loses $200 → Actual NWA = $800. When they profit back to $2000 → Actual NWA = $1000 and Liabilities show $1000 bonus credit."
- The view excludes today's date because end-of-day snapshots (FSE + FCUPNL) must both be loaded before the view is meaningful.

### 2.2 Computed Column Formulas

All computed columns use a common intermediate value:

```
NetEquity = ISNULL(TotalPositionsAmount, 0) + ISNULL(TotalCash, 0)
          + ISNULL(TotalStockOrders, 0) + ISNULL(PositionPnL, 0)
```

Note: `TotalStockOrders` is a legacy column hardcoded to 0 since 2019 (see Fact_SnapshotEquity wiki). Its presence in the formula is a historical artifact — it does not affect computation.

| Column | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| **ActualNWA** | `CASE WHEN NetEquity > BonusCredit THEN BonusCredit WHEN NetEquity < 0 THEN 0 ELSE NetEquity END` |
| **Liabilities** | `InProcessCashouts + CASE WHEN NetEquity - BonusCredit > 0 THEN NetEquity - BonusCredit WHEN NetEquity < 0 THEN NetEquity ELSE 0 END` |
| **WA_Liabilities** | `MIN(Liabilities_excl_cashouts, Credit)` — the portion of liabilities coverable by credit |
| **Liabilities_InUsedMargin** | `MAX(Liabilities_excl_cashouts - Credit, 0)` — liabilities exceeding available credit |
| **LiabilitiesStockReal** | `ISNULL(PositionPnLStocksReal, 0) + ISNULL(TotalRealStocks, 0)` |
| **LiabilitiesCryptoReal** | `ISNULL(PositionPnLCryptoReal, 0) + ISNULL(TotalRealCrypto, 0)` |
| **LiabilitiesCrypto_TRS** | `ISNULL(CryptoPositionPnL_TRS, 0) + ISNULL(Total_TRSCrypto, 0)` |
| **LiabilitiesFuturesReal** | `ISNULL(PositionPnLFuturesReal, 0) + ISNULL(TotalRealFutures, 0)` |
| **TotalStockManualPosition** | `TotalStockPositionAmount + TotalStockOrders - TotalMirrorStockPositionAmount` |
| **ManualStockPositionPnL** | `StocksPositionPnL - MirrorStocksPositionPnL` |
| **TotalCryptoManualPosition** | `TotalCryptoPositionAmount - TotalMirrorCryptoPositionAmount` |
| **TotalCryptoManualPosition_TRS** | `TotalCryptoPositionAmount_TRS - TotalMirrorCryptoPositionAmount_TRS` |

## 5. Query Advisory

- **Always filter by DateID** — the view contains the full history of daily snapshots. Unfiltered queries are expensive.
- **Balance formula**: `Liabilities + ActualNWA` or equivalently `ISNULL(RealizedEquity,0) + ISNULL(PositionPnL,0)` (Confluence)
- **TotalCash decomposition**: `TotalCash = Credit + TotalMirrorCash` (Confluence)
- **Today's data is excluded** — the WHERE clause filters `DateKey < today`. This is by design; use yesterday's date.
- **LEFT JOIN to FCUPNL**: PnL columns will be NULL for CIDs with no open positions on a given date. Use ISNULL when aggregating.

## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Fact_CustomerAction` is the unified customer event log for the eToro platform. Every significant action a customer performs — opening a position, closing a position, depositing money, withdrawing, logging in, publishing a social post, receiving a fee, getting a bonus, registering an account — is captured as a single row in this table. It answers: "What did this customer do, when, and what were the financial details?"

The table consolidates events from five distinct production sources into a single ActionTypeID-driven schema:
1. **Position opens** (ActionTypeID 1-3, 39): From `Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay` via the Generic Pipeline + staging
2. **Position closes** (ActionTypeID 4-6, 28, 40): From `History.ClosePositionEndOfDay` via the Generic Pipeline + staging
3. **Credit/financial events** (ActionTypeID 7-13, 15-20, 27, 30, 32, 34-38, 42-45): From `History.Credit` (which unions `History.ActiveCredit` + archived Credit partition tables back to 2007)
4. **Logins** (ActionTypeID 14): From `STS_Audit_UserOperationsData` (Session Tracking Service) with platform/browser detection
5. **Registrations** (ActionTypeID 41): From `Customer.CustomerStatic`

Because the table unions fundamentally different event types, **most columns are only populated for specific ActionTypeIDs**. Position-related columns (InstrumentID, Leverage, Commission, IsBuy, etc.) are NULL/0 for non-position events. Fee-specific columns (IsFeeDividend, DividendID) are only set for ActionTypeID=35. This is a sparse fact table by design.

The data originates from production systems, flows through the Azure Data Lake and DWH staging tables, and is loaded by `SP_Fact_CustomerAction_DL_To_Synapse` (staging extract) and `SP_Fact_CustomerAction` (transform + load). Post-load, `SP_Fact_CustomerAction_IsParitalCloseParent` marks partial-close parents. The load uses SWITCH partition for daily increments.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 ActionTypeID — Event Classification

**What**: Every row is classified by ActionTypeID, which determines what type of customer action occurred and which columns are populated.

**Columns Involved**: `ActionTypeID`, mapped via `DWH_dbo.Dim_ActionType`

**Rules**:

| ActionTypeID | Name | Category | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ManualPositionOpen | PositionOpen | Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay — MirrorID=0, OrigParentPositionID=0 |
| 2 | CopyPositionOpen | PositionOpen | Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay — MirrorID>0, OrigParentPositionID>0 |
| 3 | CopyPlusPositionOpen | PositionOpen | Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay — MirrorID=0, OrigParentPositionID>0 |
| 4 | ManualPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 5 | CopyPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 6 | CopyPlusPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 7 | Deposit | Deposit | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=1) |
| 8 | Cashout | Cashout | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=2) |
| 9 | Bonus | Bonus | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=7) |
| 10 | Cashout request | Cashout request | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=9) |
| 11 | Chargeback | Chargeback | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=11) |
| 12 | Refund | Refund | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=12) |
| 14 | LoggedIn | LoggedIn | STS_Audit_UserOperationsData |
| 15 | Account balance to mirror | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=18) |
| 16 | Mirror balance to account | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=19) |
| 17 | Register new mirror | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=20) |
| 18 | Unregister mirror | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=21) |
| 19 | Detach position from mirror | DetachPosition | History.Credit |
| 21-26 | Publish Post/Comment/Like, Received Post/Comment/Like | Social engagement | **DEAD DATA** — legacy rows exist but no longer updated. No active ETL. |
| 27 | DepositAttempt | DepositAttempt | History.Credit |
| 28 | DetachedPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 29 | Cashier Loggin | Cashier login | Billing.Login |
| 30 | Processed Cashout | Processed Cashout | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=2 processed) |
| 32 | Edit StopLoss | Edit StopLoss | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=13) |
| 34 | Open Stock Order | Stock order | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=29) |
| 35 | End Of The Week Fee | Fees | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=14) — overnight, weekend, dividend, SDRT, ticket fees |
| 36 | Compensation | Compensation | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=6) |
| 37 | Reverse cashout | Reverse cashout | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=8) |
| 38 | Affiliate Deposit | Deposit | History.Credit |
| 39 | PositionOpenTypeUnknown | PositionOpen | Position open without matching History.Credit (fix at weekly maintenance) |
| 40 | PositionCloseTypeUnknown | PositionClose | Position close without matching History.Credit |
| 41 | Customer Registration | Registration | Customer.CustomerStatic |
| 42 | Cashout Rollback | Chargeback | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=33) |
| 43 | Reverse Deposit | Reverse Deposit | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=32) |
| 44 | InternalDeposit | Deposit | History.Credit (MoveMoneyReasonID=5) |
| 45 | InternalWithdraw | Withdraw | History.Credit (MoveMoneyReasonID=5) |

### 2.2 IsFeeDividend — Fee Sub-Classification

**What**: For ActionTypeID=35 (End of Week Fee), classifies the specific fee type.

**Columns Involved**: `IsFeeDividend`, `Description`

**Rules** (per DSM-1463):
- `1` = Overnight/weekend fee (Description: "Over night fee", "Weekend fee")
- `2` = Dividend payment (Description LIKE '%dividend%')
- `3` = SDRT charge (Description LIKE '%sdrt%')
- `4` = Ticket fees (Description: "OpenTotalFees" or "CloseTotalFees")
- `NULL` = Not ActionTypeID=35

### 2.3 Position-Derived Columns (Shared with Dim_Position)

**What**: ~33 columns in Fact_CustomerAction are copies of the same data from `Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay` / `History.ClosePositionEndOfDay` that also populates `DWH_dbo.Dim_Position`. These columns display the same data under the same column names but are populated independently at ETL time.

**Shared columns**: `PositionID`, `InstrumentID`, `Amount`, `Leverage`, `Commission`, `CommissionOnClose`, `FullCommission`, `FullCommissionOnClose`, `MirrorID`, `IsSettled`, `InitialUnits`, `IsDiscounted`, `CommissionByUnits`, `FullCommissionByUnits`, `RegulationIDOnOpen`, `ReopenForPositionID`, `IsReOpen`, `CommissionOnCloseOrig`, `FullCommissionOnCloseOrig`, `OriginalPositionID`, `IsPartialCloseParent`, `IsPartialCloseChild`, `IsAirDrop`, `SettlementTypeID`, `DLTOpen`, `DLTClose`, `OpenMarkupByUnits`, `IsBuy`, `NetProfit`, `RedeemStatus`, `RedeemID`, `IsRedeem`

**Rules**:
- These columns are ONLY populated for position events (ActionTypeID IN 1-6, 28, 39, 40)
- For non-position events, these columns are 0 or NULL
- The ETL joins from staging tables directly — NOT from Dim_Position itself
- Column meanings are identical to Dim_Position (see `Dim_Position.md` for detailed descriptions)

### 2.4 PlatformID — Product/Platform Resolution

**What**: Identifies which product/platform the action originated from. Badly named — it's actually a FK to `Dim_Product.ProductID`, not a standalone platform enum.

**Columns Involved**: `PlatformID`

**Rules**:
- Only populated for ActionTypeID=14 (logins) and 41 (registrations)
- Resolve via JOIN to `DWH_dbo.Dim_Product` — provides Product, Platform, and SubPlatform columns
- Do NOT hard-code value mappings (101=Android, etc.) — always JOIN to Dim_Product

**Query pattern**:
```sql
SELECT dp.Product, dp.Platform, dp.SubPlatform, fca.*
FROM DWH_dbo.Fact_CustomerAction fca
JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_Product dp ON fca.PlatformID = dp.ProductID
WHERE fca.ActionTypeID = 14
```

### 2.6 Reopen Commission Adjustment

**What**: For reopened positions (IsReOpen=1), the commission at close is adjusted.

**Columns Involved**: `CommissionOnClose`, `FullCommissionOnClose`, `CommissionOnCloseOrig`, `FullCommissionOnCloseOrig`, `IsReOpen`, `ReopenForPositionID`

**Rules**:
- `CommissionOnClose = new_position.CommissionOnClose - original_position.CommissionOnClose`
- `CommissionOnCloseOrig` / `FullCommissionOnCloseOrig` preserve original values

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is HASH-distributed on `RealCID` with a CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX + 4 nonclustered indexes (`ActionTypeID+DateID`, `ActionTypeID`, `CompensationReasonID`, `RealCID+DateID`). Always include `RealCID` in WHERE or JOIN for optimal single-distribution queries. The columnstore index enables efficient analytical scans across the ~11B rows.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, this table is stored as **Delta** (EXTERNAL, ~430 GB, ~7K files), partitioned by `etr_y`, `etr_ym`, `etr_ymd` (year, year-month, year-month-day). Always include partition columns in WHERE clauses for partition pruning — e.g., `WHERE etr_y = '2025' AND etr_ym = '202503'` will skip scanning irrelevant partitions. Given the table's ~11B rows, partition pruning is critical for any practical query. The partition columns are Databricks-layer additions not present in the Synapse source. Deletion vectors are enabled (`delta.enableDeletionVectors = true`).

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| All logins for a customer | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 14 AND RealCID = @cid` |
| Position opens in a date range | `WHERE ActionTypeID IN (1,2,3) AND DateID BETWEEN @start AND @end` |
| Revenue (commissions) | `WHERE ActionTypeID IN (1,2,3,4,5,6,28) AND Commission > 0` |
| Deposits for a customer | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 7 AND RealCID = @cid` |
| Overnight fees | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 35 AND IsFeeDividend = 1` |
| Dividend payments | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 35 AND IsFeeDividend = 2` |
| First-time deposits (FTD) | `WHERE IsFTD = 1` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **Most columns are only populated for specific ActionTypeIDs.** InstrumentID, Leverage, Commission, IsBuy are all 0/NULL for logins, deposits, social events, etc.
- **11 billion rows** — always filter by ActionTypeID + DateID to avoid full scans
- **IsReal is always 1** in this table — it only contains real-account actions (no demo)
- **Leverage=0 means non-position event**, not "no leverage". For actual position opens, Leverage=1 means no leverage (real ownership)
- **IsBuy NULL** means non-position event. For position events: True=Buy, False=Sell
- **Description is sparse** — only populated for fee events (ActionTypeID=35) and a few others. Contains human-readable strings like "Over night fee", "Payment caused by dividend", "OpenTotalFees"
- **PlatformTypeID** vs **PlatformID**: PlatformTypeID is a legacy field (0=default, 99=STS); PlatformID is a FK to `Dim_Product.ProductID` (badly named — always JOIN to Dim_Product, don't hard-code values)
- **StatusID is nearly always 1** (~11B rows with StatusID=1, ~2M NULL)
- **DemoCID is always 0** (real accounts only)
- **HistoryID is NOT unique** — despite being intended as a key, it contains duplicates. Never use it for JOINs, deduplication, or row identification

## 1. Business Meaning

`Dim_Customer` is the DWH's central customer master table — the single point of reference for all customer attributes in analytics and reporting. It consolidates data from 14+ production staging tables spanning multiple microservices (Customer, BackOffice, Billing, Compliance, STS Audit, UserAPI, SalesForce, ContactVerification) into one denormalized row per customer.

The table follows a Type 1 SCD (Slowly Changing Dimension) pattern: each daily ETL run detects changes across 50+ columns and performs a DELETE/INSERT for modified customers, preserving certain indicator fields (deposit history, avatar, document proofs, Tangany/DLT/EquiLend IDs) that are maintained independently of the core change cycle.

Two UC copies exist:
- **Masked**: `main.dwh.gold_...dim_customer_masked` — PII columns contain masked values, accessible to general analytics
- **Unmasked**: `main.pii_data.gold_...dim_customer` — full PII, restricted access

### Business Usage

- **Regulatory Reporting**: Confluence "Business & Regulatory Undertakings Monitoring Platform" JOINs `Dim_Customer` on CID=RealCID for country, regulation, and status filtering
- **BI Queries**: Nearly every DWH fact table JOINs to Dim_Customer (via CID=RealCID) for customer segmentation
- **Synapse Training**: Confluence "Temporary Tables in Synapse" uses Dim_Customer as a reference example for HASH distribution optimization

### 2.2 ETL Pipeline (SP_Dim_Customer_DL_To_Synapse → SP_Dim_Customer)

```
ORCHESTRATOR (SP_Dim_Customer_DL_To_Synapse):
  1. Load 14 staging/external tables:
     Ext_Dim_Customer_Affiliate, Ext_Dim_Customer_BOCustomer, Ext_Dim_Customer_2FA,
     Ext_Dim_Customer_PhoneCustomer, Ext_Dim_Customer_Customer, Ext_Dim_Customer_Avatars,

     Ext_Dim_CustomerStatic, Ext_Dim_Customer_CustomerIdentification, Ext_Dim_Customer_StocksLending
  2. EXEC SP_Dim_Customer

CORE LOGIC (SP_Dim_Customer):
  Step 1: Build #customer — JOIN Ext_Customer_Customer + Ext_BOCustomer
          Compute: IsValidCustomer, IsCreditReportValidCB
          Rename: SerialID→AffiliateID, ManagerID→AccountManagerID, isEmployeeAccount→EmployeeAccount
  Step 2: Detect #new (CIDs not yet in Dim_Customer)
  Step 3: Detect #update (50+ column comparison using ISNULL + COLLATE)
  Step 4: Build #full_list (new OR updated CIDs) with 2FA from Ext_2FA
  Step 5: Preserve #CustomerInitalIndicaton (deposit, avatar, document, Tangany, DLT, phone, FTD fields)
  Step 6: BEGIN TRAN: DELETE matching CIDs → INSERT with preserved indicators
  Step 7: Post-transaction UPDATEs:
          Avatar → HasAvatar, AvatarUploadDate
          Deposit → IsDepositor, FirstDepositDate, FirstDepositAmount, FTD fields
          ScreeningStatusID → from screening service
          SalesForceAccountID → from SF ID map
          Document proofs → IsAddressProof, IsIDProof + expiry dates
          2FA → from audit log
          SubChannelID → from affiliate mapping
          ApexID → from CustomerStatic
          Phone → PhoneNumber, IsPhoneVerified, PhoneVerificationDate
          Tangany → TanganyID, TanganyStatusID
          DLT → DltID, DltStatusID
          StocksLending → EquiLendID, StocksLendingStatusID
  Step 8: Populate Ext_Dim_Customer_ExternalID_GCID, update UserName_Lower

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 4.1 Change Detection (CDC-Style)

The SP compares 50+ columns between `#customer` (staging) and existing `Dim_Customer` using `ISNULL(old,0) <> ISNULL(new,0)` with explicit `COLLATE Latin1_General_100_BIN` for string columns. Only customers with actual changes (or new customers) are processed. This prevents unnecessary row churn.

### 4.2 Indicator Preservation

When a customer row is updated (DELETE+INSERT), certain indicator fields are preserved from the old row via `#CustomerInitalIndicaton`: FirstDepositAmount, FirstDepositDate, HasAvatar, IsDepositor, ScreeningStatusID, SalesForceAccountID, document proofs, WorldCheckID, Tangany, Phone, EquiLend, DLT, FTD fields. These are then refreshed in subsequent post-load UPDATEs if new data is available.

### 4.3 Multi-Source Identity Resolution

Customer attributes come from multiple microservices. The ETL uses `ISNULL(history_version, current_value)` patterns to prefer the latest History version (with temporal filtering: ValidFrom < @CurrentDate, ValidFrom >= @DelayDate, ValidTo >= @CurrentDate) over the current snapshot, ensuring the most up-to-date attribute values are captured.

### 4.4 FTD Recovery Date Logic

The `FirstDepositDate` is updated using: if the existing `FirstDepositDate` (as date) is earlier than `FTDRecoveryDate`, use `FTDRecoveryDate`; otherwise use the `FTDDate`. This handles cases where an FTD was reversed and re-deposited on a different day.

### 4.5 IsValidCustomer Business Rule

```
IsValidCustomer = 1 WHEN:
  PlayerLevelID ≠ 4 (not Popular Investor)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (30, 26) (not bonus-only or specific label)
  AND CountryID ≠ 250
```

This excludes demo-like, internal, and specific-jurisdiction accounts from standard reporting.

## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Dim_Mirror` is the DWH's primary record of all copy-trading relationships on the eToro platform. A "mirror" is the connection established when Customer A (the copier, `CID`) chooses to copy Customer B (the copied person, `ParentCID`/`ParentUserName`). Once established, trades opened by B are automatically mirrored proportionally in A's account, scaled to the mirror's `Amount`.

The table covers the full history of eToro's social trading product from its earliest CopyTrader relationships in 2011 through the present. It holds 11,145,368 rows across four mirror types: Regular copy (85.2%), Fund mirrors (14.1%), CopyMe/Popular Investor (0.7%), and Smart Portfolio/Social Index (0.001%).

**ETL pattern**: Incremental daily differential. The SP (`SP_Dim_Mirror_DL_To_Synapse`) merges updates from two staging sources:
1. `etoro_Trade_Mirror` -- real-time active mirrors (open positions)
2. `etoro_History_Mirror` -- historical/closed mirrors (close events with final P&L)

Rows are never deleted from Dim_Mirror (except for same-day re-processing). The `CloseDateID=0` / `CloseOccurred='1900-01-01'` sentinel marks currently open mirrors.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Open vs. Closed Mirror Sentinel

**What**: A mirror may be open (still actively copying) or closed. The SP uses sentinel values to distinguish open mirrors from closed ones.

**Columns Involved**: `CloseOccurred`, `CloseDateID`, `IsActive`

**Rules**:
- **Open mirror**: `CloseDateID = 0`, `CloseOccurred = '1900-01-01 00:00:00'`. This is the active sentinel -- the copier is still copying.
- **Closed mirror**: `CloseDateID > 0`, `CloseOccurred` = actual close datetime. The copier stopped copying.
- **IsActive**: Production flag from Trade.Mirror / History.Mirror. Can be 0 for rows where `CloseDateID=0` (e.g., paused or deactivated but not formally closed). Do not rely on IsActive alone for open/closed filtering -- use `CloseDateID = 0`.
- **For filtering active mirrors**: `WHERE CloseDateID = 0` (669,921 currently open: 468,911 Regular + 9 CopyMe + 201,001 Fund)

### 2.2 Dual-Source ETL (Real vs. History)

**What**: Open mirrors come from `Trade.Mirror` (real-time system table); closed mirrors come from `History.Mirror` (event log). The daily SP merges both.

**Rules**:
- `etoro_Trade_Mirror` provides the current state of each open mirror (IsActive, Amount, risk settings, running P&L).
- `etoro_History_Mirror MirrorOperationID=2` provides close events (CloseOccurred, CloseDateID, RealziedPnL at close).
- `etoro_History_Mirror MirrorOperationID=1` provides open events (SessionID at open time).
- When a mirror appears in both History (closed today) and Real (still shown as open), History takes precedence (duplicates removed).
- Close dates with CloseOccurred >= today are treated as still-open and get sentinel values (1900-01-01, CloseDateID=0).

### 2.3 IsCopyFundMirror Derivation

**What**: `IsCopyFundMirror` identifies mirrors where the copied entity is an eToro-managed fund account, not a regular customer.

**Rule**: `IsCopyFundMirror = 1` when `ParentCID` is in `etoro_BackOffice_Customer WHERE AccountTypeID = 9` (Fund account type). NULL/0 for regular customer-to-customer copies. Fund mirrors are a distinct product from the Regular CopyTrader relationship.

### 2.4 RealziedPnL Typo

**What**: The column `RealziedPnL` contains the realized profit/loss for the mirror (net profit at close). The column name has a persistent typo ("Realzied" instead of "Realized") that exists in both the DDL and the SP.

**Rule**: This column is populated from `History.Mirror.NetProfit` at close time. For open mirrors, it reflects the running net profit at the last SP update. Always reference as `RealziedPnL` (with the typo) in queries -- the DDL name is authoritative.

### 2.5 MirrorSL and Risk Controls

**What**: Copy-trading relationships can have a stop-loss that automatically closes the mirror if losses exceed a threshold.

**Columns Involved**: `MirrorSL`, `MirrorSLPercentage`, `PauseCopy`

**Rules**:
- `MirrorSL`: Stop-loss amount in absolute USD terms. Mirror closes if cumulative loss reaches this amount.
- `MirrorSLPercentage`: Stop-loss as percentage of `InitialInvestment`. A setting of 40 means "close mirror if I lose 40% of my initial investment".
- `PauseCopy`: 1 if the copier has paused the copy (no new trades are mirrored). Paused copies are still open (CloseDateID=0) but not actively mirroring new trades.

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**HASH(MirrorID)**: MirrorID is the distribution key. JOINs on MirrorID are co-located (no shuffle). JOINs on CID, ParentCID, or OpenDateID may require broadcast/shuffle -- consider the fact table's distribution when planning multi-table JOINs.

**CLUSTERED INDEX (OpenDateID, MirrorID)**: Optimized for date-filtered queries on OpenDateID + MirrorID lookup. The two NC indexes support:
- `IX_Dim_Mirror`: OpenOccurred scans (datetime-based open date filtering)
- `IX_Dim_Mirror_ParentCID`: ParentCID lookups (find all copiers of a given Popular Investor)

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Count currently active copy relationships | `WHERE CloseDateID = 0 AND MirrorTypeID = 1` |
| Find all copiers of a specific Popular Investor | `WHERE ParentCID = X AND MirrorTypeID IN (1, 2)` |
| Mirror P&L attribution | `JOIN Dim_Mirror ON MirrorID; SELECT RealziedPnL, InitialInvestment` |
| Date-range analysis of new copy relationships | `WHERE OpenDateID BETWEEN 20250101 AND 20250131` |
| Identify copies with stop-loss set | `WHERE MirrorSL > 0 OR MirrorSLPercentage > 0` |
| Find paused copies | `WHERE PauseCopy = 1 AND CloseDateID = 0` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_MirrorType | `ON MirrorTypeID` | Get copy type name (Regular, CopyMe, Social Index, Fund) |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Date | `ON OpenDateID` or `CloseDateID` | Calendar metadata for open/close dates |
| CustomerStatic (or similar) | `ON CID` | Copier customer details |
| CustomerStatic | `ON ParentCID` | Copied person (Popular Investor) details |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **CloseOccurred='1900-01-01' = open mirror**: Do NOT interpret this as a historical date. It is the ETL sentinel for "not yet closed". Filter `WHERE CloseDateID = 0` for open mirrors.
- **RealziedPnL has a typo**: Column name is `RealziedPnL` (not `RealizedPnL`). This is the authoritative DDL name -- use the typo in queries.
- **IsActive is not a reliable closed indicator**: Use `CloseDateID = 0` for "is open". IsActive can be 0 for open-but-paused mirrors.
- **11.1M rows, never truncated**: Full table scans are expensive. Always filter on `OpenDateID` (clustered key) or `MirrorID` (distribution/hash key) for efficient queries.
- **MirrorTypeID=3 (Social Index) only 122 rows**: This product type has minimal representation -- likely a legacy or very limited product.
- **IsCopyFundMirror NULL vs 0**: The column can be NULL (not set in older rows) or 0/1. `ISNULL(IsCopyFundMirror, 0) = 1` for fund mirror filtering.
- **SessionID NULL for old rows**: The SessionID column was added later; historical mirrors (pre-2011 to early 2020s) may have NULL SessionID.

## 1. Business Meaning

Daily per-PI and per-Portfolio-account performance snapshot. Each row represents one **Popular Investor (PI) or Portfolio account** on a specific `Date`, capturing their identity, PI tier, equity composition, AUM, copier count, commission earned, mirror flow activity (MIMO), and risk metrics.

The table is **append-mode** — each daily load adds rows for `Date=@date` without touching prior history. It is the primary input for PI performance dashboards, tier-change analysis, and account manager reporting. Coverage includes:
- **PIs**: Active Popular Investors (GuruStatusID >= 2, IsValidCustomer=1)
- **Portfolio accounts**: Accounts with AccountTypeID=9

Population is derived from `DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer` joined to `DWH_dbo.Dim_Range` to find which customers were active on the reporting date.

**Known column typos in DDL**: `CurrenyEquity` (→ CurrentEquity/CurrencyEquity), `ProtfoilioType` (→ PortfolioType), `MifidCatigorization` (→ MifidCategorization), `DaysInCurrnetStatus` (→ DaysInCurrentStatus). These are legacy column names and cannot be renamed without pipeline changes.

---

## 2. Business Logic & Derivation Rules

### Population Filter
```
Fact_SnapshotCustomer JOIN Dim_Range
WHERE (GuruStatusID >= 2 AND IsValidCustomer = 1) OR AccountTypeID = 9
AND @date_int BETWEEN Dim_Range.FromDateID AND Dim_Range.ToDateID
```
Uses `Dim_Range` date-range semantics (SCD-style validity windows) rather than a direct date column.

### Risk Score (`LastNightRiskScore`)
10-band volatility-to-score mapping from `DWH_dbo.V_Liabilities.StandardDeviation`:

| StandardDeviation Range | Score |
|------------------------|-------|
| < 0.0011 | 1 |
| < 0.0024 | 2 |
| < 0.0040 | 3 |
| < 0.0055 | 4 |
| < 0.0079 | 5 |
| < 0.0111 | 6 |
| < 0.0158 | 7 |
| < 0.0316 | 8 |
| < 0.0475 | 9 |
| >= 0.0475 | 10 |
| No match / NULL | 0 |

### Equity Decomposition (from `DWH_dbo.V_Liabilities`)

| Column | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| TotalEquity | Liabilities + ActualNWA |
| CurrenyEquity | TotalPositionsAmount + PositionPnL (typo: should be CurrentEquity) |
| PI_CopyAUM | AUM + CopyPositionPnL |
| PI_ManualStocks | TotalStockManualPosition + ManualStockPositionPnL |
| PI_ManualCrypto | TotalCryptoManualPosition + ManualCryptoPositionPnL |

**Manual trading estimate** (comment in SP): `ManualTrading ≈ TotalEquity − PI_CopyAUM − PI_ManualStocks − PI_ManualCrypto − Credit − InProcessCashouts`

### Commission Accumulation
**Accumulates from 2011-01-01** (hardcoded `@start_date = '20110101'`) to `@date`. Multi-condition logic per position:
- Position opened AND closed within window: `ISNULL(FullCommissionOnClose, CommissionOnClose)`
- Position opened within window but still open: `ISNULL(FullCommission, Commission)`
- Position closed within window but opened before: `ISNULL(FullCommissionOnClose - FullCommission, CommissionOnClose - Commission)`

### MIMO (Mirror In / Mirror Out) from `Fact_CustomerAction` — DateID = @date only
| Column | Action Types | Logic |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| MI | 15 (Mirror In), 17 (New Mirror) | SUM(-Amount) |
| MO | 16 (Mirror Out), 18 (UnMirror) | SUM(Amount) |
| netMI | 15, 16, 17, 18 | SUM(-Amount) net |
| NewMirror | 17 | COUNT of new copy-start events |
| UnMirror | 18 | COUNT of copy-stop events |

### DaysInCurrnetStatus (typo for DaysInCurrentStatus)
Finds the first date the PI entered their current GuruStatus tier by examining status-change transitions in `Fact_SnapshotCustomer`. Uses two branches:
1. **Status has changed before**: MIN(FromDateID) after the last status transition
2. **Status has never changed**: MIN(FromDateID) in Fact_SnapshotCustomer for the CID

### LastContactDate
Most recent `Phone_Call_Succeed__c` or `Completed_Contact_Email__c` action in `BI_DB_UsageTracking_SF`, where `CreatedByManagerID = ManagerID` (manager-matched contact). Sentinel: `ISNULL(CreatedDate, '1900-01-01')` — use `> '1900-01-01'` to filter for actual contacts.

### PI_Level_Previous
Yesterday's GuruStatusName from `Fact_SnapshotCustomer` at `@date - 1`. NULL if the PI had no prior snapshot record.

### PnL Section (Commented Out)
The `--,[PnL]` column is in the SP's INSERT column list but commented out. The `#PnL` calculation block is also commented. This column does NOT exist in the table.

---

## 3. Query Advisory

- **ROUND_ROBIN distributed** — filter on `Date` or `DateID` for efficiency; joins on `CID` will trigger data movement.
- **Append-mode table** — always filter by `Date` or `DateID`. Without a date filter, the query scans all history.
- **`commission` accumulates from 2011-01-01** — not a daily delta. Do not SUM across dates; each row already contains the cumulative figure for that PI.
- **`LastContactDate = '1900-01-01'`** means no contact recorded (sentinel, not a real date).
- **`LastNightRiskScore = 0`** means no V_Liabilities row or StandardDeviation was NULL.
- **`PI_Level_Previous` is NULL** for PIs without a prior day's record (e.g., new PIs).
- **`CurrenyEquity`** (typo) = `TotalPositionsAmount + PositionPnL` (current open position value including unrealized P&L). Do NOT confuse with `TotalEquity`.
- **`Language` is char(500)** — grossly over-provisioned; actual language names are short (< 30 chars). RTRIM() if needed.
- **`Country` and `Region` are varchar(500)** — similarly over-provisioned.
- **`CopyType`**: 'Portfolio' for AccountTypeID=9, 'PI' for all others.
- **Duplicate-run safety**: DELETE WHERE Date=@date before INSERT ensures idempotent loads.
