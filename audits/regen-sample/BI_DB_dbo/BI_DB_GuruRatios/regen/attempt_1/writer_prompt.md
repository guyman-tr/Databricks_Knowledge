# Regen Harness — Writer Prompt

# Regen Harness — Writer (single-object mode)

You are running the DWH Semantic Documentation pipeline on **ONE OBJECT** in
isolated regen-harness mode. This is NOT the normal batch loop. You are NOT
reading `_index.md`, NOT updating any index file, NOT processing other
objects, NOT running cross-schema sync. You document one object end-to-end and
exit.

---

## ⛔ MCP PRE-FLIGHT — MANDATORY

Before reading any rule files or DDL:

1. Call `mcp__synapse_sql__execute_sql_read_only` with `SELECT 1 AS mcp_preflight`.
2. **If it fails or the tool does not exist**: print `REGEN ABORT: Synapse MCP unavailable` and **EXIT IMMEDIATELY**. A wiki without live data sampling is INCOMPLETE and WILL FAIL the adversarial judge.
3. **If it succeeds**: print `MCP PRE-FLIGHT: PASS` and continue.

No exceptions. No "code-only documentation" fallback. No "I'll skip Phase 2 because the table looks dormant" — the judge sees the dormant footer too and will fail you for missing data evidence.

---

## ⛔ PHASE 3 DISTRIBUTION CAP

Phase 3 (distribution analysis) is capped at **at most 3 categorical columns**
per object. Pick those whose names match the regex
`Status|Type|Code|Country|Region|Currency|Category|Reg|Score|Group|Kind|Class`.
Skip free-text columns entirely (Email, Description, Comment, Note, Address,
Name, Url, Subject, Body, Reason).

If fewer than 3 columns match the regex, run distribution queries on however
many DO match — running zero distribution queries is OK if the table has no
obviously-categorical columns.

---

## ⛔ OUTPUT DIRECTORY GUARANTEE

The directory listed under **Absolute output directory** in the Object Header
ALREADY EXISTS, was created by the harness, and is empty (apart from the
writer_prompt.md you are reading). DO NOT run `Bash ls` to check it. DO NOT
run `Bash mkdir`. Just call `Write` directly with the absolute paths from the
Object Header for the three required files.

---

## ⛔ PRE-RESOLVED UPSTREAM CONTEXT — your Tier 1 inheritance source is below, USE IT

The block titled **"## PRE-RESOLVED UPSTREAM BUNDLE"** in this prompt was
assembled **deterministically by the harness, before you started**. It contains:

- The **DDL** for the object you are documenting (verbatim from SSDT).
- Every **upstream wiki** the harness could resolve from the existing
  `.lineage.md` plus DDL-derived references — both local Synapse wikis and
  remote production-DB wikis (DB_Schema, ExperianceDBs, etc.).
- For any stored procedure mentioned in the lineage, the **SP source code**
  pulled from `DataPlatform\SynapseSQLPool1\sql_dp_prod_we\...`.

**Treat this bundle as your AUTHORITATIVE source for Tier 1 inheritance.** You
are NOT permitted to claim "no upstream wiki could be found" if the bundle
contains one. You ARE permitted to read additional files via the `Read` tool
if you need more context.

### Tier rules — re-stated, NON-NEGOTIABLE

For every column in the object:

1. **Passthrough or rename WITH upstream wiki present in the bundle** →
   **Tier 1**. Description MUST be a verbatim quote from the upstream wiki.
   Do not paraphrase. Do not "improve". Do not generalize vendor names. Do not
   drop NULL semantics. The judge will run a character-by-character
   comparison.
2. **ETL-computed** (CASE / arithmetic / aggregation visible in the SP source) →
   **Tier 2** with the transform stated. The source after `(Tier 2 — …)` MUST
   name the **upstream TABLE the transform reads from**, NOT the SP that
   performs the transform. The SP is the tool; the table is the data source.
   Examples:
   - `ABS(Fact_Deposit_State.Amount)` → `(Tier 2 — Fact_Deposit_State)`
   - `CASE WHEN x.IsSettled = 1 THEN 'Real' END` → `(Tier 2 — Fact_BillingDeposit)`
   - Pure passthrough from a DWH fact (no production wiki) →
     `(Tier 2 — Fact_X)`, NOT `(Tier 2 — SP_X)`.
   - Multi-source UNION → list both tables, slash-separated:
     `(Tier 2 — Fact_Deposit_State / Fact_Cashout_State)`.
   The ONLY case where an SP name belongs in the source is when the column is
   purely synthesized inside the SP with no input table column (e.g.
   `GETDATE()`, `@StartDateID`, fixed literal). Then write `(Tier 2 — SP_X)`.
3. **Dim-lookup passthrough** (`SELECT dim.X` with no transform AND `Dim_X`
   has its own Tier 1 origin documented in the bundle) → **Tier 1 with the
   dim's origin** (e.g. `Dictionary.Country`), NOT `Tier 2 via SP_X` and NOT
   `Tier 1 via Dim_X` (Dim_X is a relay, not a root). Quote the dim's wiki
   verbatim.
4. **No source traceable from bundle, DDL, JOINs, or SP source** →
   **Tier 3** with explicit reason. Be specific: "PII column, no upstream wiki
   located, name suggests …".
5. **`Tier 4 — inferred from name`** is BANNED unless the bundle explicitly
   shows the column has no upstream and no SP code touches it. Lazy Tier 4 is
   the #1 reason wikis fail the judge. If you are tempted to write Tier 4
   with no other evidence, you have skipped Phase 9 — go back and read the
   SP source in the bundle.

### Footer rules

- If the bundle contains AT LEAST ONE upstream wiki: the footer MUST identify
  the production source(s). Writing `Production Source: Unknown (dormant)`
  when the bundle proves an upstream exists is an automatic fail.
- If `_no_upstream_found.txt` exists in the regen folder: it is OK to mark
  the table as dormant in the footer, but you MUST still ground every column
  description in the DDL + SP code rather than `Tier 4 — inferred`.

---

## Output paths — write here, NOT into the main wiki tree

Write all THREE output files into:

```
audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/
  {Object}.md
  {Object}.lineage.md
  {Object}.review-needed.md
```

`{Schema}`, `{Object}`, and `{N}` are passed in via the prompt header below.

**DO NOT** write into `knowledge/synapse/Wiki/` under any circumstances. The
main tree is read-only for this run. **DO NOT** modify `_index.md` or any
`_batch_context.json`. **DO NOT** generate `.alter.sql`. **DO NOT** run Phase
16 — the adversarial judge runs as a separate, fresh claude process AFTER you
exit. Pretending to evaluate yourself wastes tokens.

---

## Pipeline scope for this single object

Run phases 1 through 11 inclusive. Skip Phase 16. Skip Phase 11W (no ALTER).
Skip cross-object index updates. Skip `_batch_context.json` writes.

Required phase gates (you must print them as you complete each):

```
PHASE GATE — {Schema}.{Object}:
  [x] P1 DDL          [x] P2 Sample        [x] P3 Dist
  [x] P4 Lookup       [x] P5 JOIN          [x] P6 BizLogic
  [x] P7 Views        [x] P8 SP-scan       [x] P9 SP-logic
  [x] P9B ETL         [x] P10 Jira         [x] P10A Upstream
  [x] P10B Lineage    → Ready for P11
```

If a phase truly cannot run (e.g. no SPs reference the table), mark it `[-]`
with a one-line reason. Skipping P2 or P3 because "the table is small" is
NOT a valid reason — sample it.

---

## Outputs — three files, exact shape

Follow the GOLDEN-REFERENCE in
`.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/GOLDEN-REFERENCE.mdc`.

1. **`{Object}.lineage.md`** — written FIRST (Phase 10B). Source Objects
   table + Column Lineage table. Every Tier 1 row must point to a file in the
   pre-resolved bundle (or to a wiki you read independently).
2. **`{Object}.md`** — the main wiki, 8 sections, every column in
   Section 4's Elements table, every description ending with
   `(Tier N — source)`.
3. **`{Object}.review-needed.md`** — items needing human review. MUST NOT
   contain a `## 4. Elements` section.

---

## Final checklist before exiting

Print, verbatim:

```
OUTPUT CHECK — {Schema}.{Object}:
  [x] .lineage.md    written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.lineage.md
  [x] .md            written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.md
  [x] .review-needed.md written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.review-needed.md
  [-] .alter.sql     deferred (regen harness — judge runs next)
  Tier1 columns: N    Tier2: N    Tier3: N    Tier4: N
  Bundle inheritance used: YES/NO  (NO is only valid if `_no_upstream_found.txt` exists)
```

Then EXIT. Do not run a self-evaluation. Do not "double-check by re-reading
the wiki you just wrote". Do not append a verdict block. The judge runs in a
separate process with its own context.

# build-wiki-bidb-batch

You are running the DWH Semantic Documentation pipeline for schema BI_DB_dbo.
**Wiki-only mode** — generate documentation files only. ALTER scripts are generated separately later via `/generate-alter-dwh`.

## ⛔ MCP PRE-FLIGHT — NON-NEGOTIABLE, CHECK BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

Before loading rules, before reading the index, before planning anything:

1. **Test Synapse MCP**: Call `mcp__synapse_sql__execute_sql_read_only` with `SELECT 1 AS mcp_preflight`
2. **If it fails or the tool does not exist**: Print `BATCH ABORT: Synapse MCP unavailable` and **EXIT IMMEDIATELY**. Do NOT proceed. Do NOT fall back to "prior batch context data". Do NOT use a "schema practice" of skipping MCP. A wiki without live data sampling is INCOMPLETE and WILL NOT PASS the adversarial evaluator. STOP HERE.
3. **If it succeeds**: Print `MCP PRE-FLIGHT: PASS` and continue to Instructions.

There is NO exception to this rule. No "prior context", no "code-only documentation", no "graceful degradation". MCP down = batch aborted. Period.

---

## Instructions (regen-harness, single object)

1. **Load rules** — read these in order before anything else:
   - `.cursor/rules/semantic-layer-core/repo-first-access.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/00-execution-card.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/mcp-query-rules.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/GOLDEN-REFERENCE.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/10.5b-tier1-enforcement.mdc`

2. **Skip batch planning** — do NOT read `_index.md`, do NOT touch
   `_batch_context.json`, do NOT scan the blacklist. The harness
   already chose this object.

3. **Run the pipeline for THIS object only**: phases 1 through 11
   inclusive. Use the pre-resolved upstream bundle (provided below)
   as your authoritative Tier 1 source. Generate three files in
   `audits/regen-sample/{schema}/{object}/regen/attempt_{N}/`:
   `.lineage.md`, `.md`, `.review-needed.md`. Do NOT generate
   `.alter.sql`. Do NOT modify any file under `knowledge/synapse/Wiki/`.

4. **Skip Phase 16** — the adversarial judge runs in a separate,
   fresh claude process after you exit. Self-evaluation here wastes
   tokens and pollutes the comparison.

5. **Exit cleanly** after printing the OUTPUT CHECK block defined in
   the Regen Harness preamble.

## Key resources

## 1. Business Meaning

`V_Liabilities` is the platform's primary view for computing what eToro owes each customer (liabilities) and how much of the customer's balance is "real" vs promotional credit.

**Core formula** — let `NetEquity = TotalPositionsAmount + TotalCash + TotalStockOrders + PositionPnL`:
- **ActualNWA** (Non-Withdrawable Amount): The portion of NetEquity covered by BonusCredit. Clamped to `[0, BonusCredit]`. If the customer's NetEquity exceeds their BonusCredit, ActualNWA = BonusCredit. If NetEquity goes negative, ActualNWA = 0.
- **Liabilities**: InProcessCashouts + the portion of NetEquity **above** BonusCredit. This is what eToro owes the customer — real money, not promotional credit.
- **Balance**: Liabilities + ActualNWA = RealizedEquity + PositionPnL (Confluence: "Summary of V-Liabilities")

**Business context** (from Confluence):
- "If clients lose money, their Actual NWA will reflect only what's left. A client has $1000, loses $200 → Actual NWA = $800. When they profit back to $2000 → Actual NWA = $1000 and Liabilities show $1000 bonus credit."
- The view excludes today's date because end-of-day snapshots (FSE + FCUPNL) must both be loaded before the view is meaningful.

**Key consumers**: SP_DDR_Fact_AUM, SP_Client_Balance_New, SP_Client_Balance_Breakdown, SP_Q_AML_EDD_US_Report, SP_Q_AML_FSA_Report, SP_AML_PI_Abuse, SP_AML_BI_Alerts_New_Singapore, SP_CIDFirstDates, SP_CID_DailyPanel_FullData, SP_CID_MonthlyPanel_FullData, SP_MarketingCloudDaily, SP_Copyfunds_SignificantAllocation, SP_Fact_RegulationTransfer, SP_TIN_Gap, SP_BI_DB_W8_Users_Status, SP_BI_DB_CO_Cluster_Daily, SP_IR_Dashboard_Monitor_Checks, SP_OPS_MultipleAccounts, SP_Q_QSR_New.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Join Structure

```
Fact_SnapshotEquity a                   -- daily equity snapshot per CID
  JOIN V_M2M_Date_DateRange b           -- expands DateRangeID → one row per calendar day (DateKey)
    ON a.DateRangeID = b.DateRangeID
  LEFT JOIN Fact_CustomerUnrealized_PnL c  -- daily PnL snapshot per CID
    ON a.CID = c.CID AND b.DateKey = c.DateModified
  LEFT JOIN Fact_Guru_Copiers gc        -- DEAD JOIN: no columns selected (Boris Slutski, 2021-01-11)
    ON a.CID = gc.CID AND b.DateKey = gc.DateID
WHERE b.DateKey < today
```

### 2.2 Computed Column Formulas

All computed columns use a common intermediate value:

```
NetEquity = ISNULL(TotalPositionsAmount, 0) + ISNULL(TotalCash, 0)
          + ISNULL(TotalStockOrders, 0) + ISNULL(PositionPnL, 0)
```

Note: `TotalStockOrders` is a legacy column hardcoded to 0 since 2019 (see Fact_SnapshotEquity wiki). Its presence in the formula is a historical artifact — it does not affect computation.

| Column | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| **ActualNWA** | `CASE WHEN NetEquity > BonusCredit THEN BonusCredit WHEN NetEquity < 0 THEN 0 ELSE NetEquity END` |
| **Liabilities** | `InProcessCashouts + CASE WHEN NetEquity - BonusCredit > 0 THEN NetEquity - BonusCredit WHEN NetEquity < 0 THEN NetEquity ELSE 0 END` |
| **WA_Liabilities** | `MIN(Liabilities_excl_cashouts, Credit)` — the portion of liabilities coverable by credit |
| **Liabilities_InUsedMargin** | `MAX(Liabilities_excl_cashouts - Credit, 0)` — liabilities exceeding available credit |
| **LiabilitiesStockReal** | `ISNULL(PositionPnLStocksReal, 0) + ISNULL(TotalRealStocks, 0)` |
| **LiabilitiesCryptoReal** | `ISNULL(PositionPnLCryptoReal, 0) + ISNULL(TotalRealCrypto, 0)` |
| **LiabilitiesCrypto_TRS** | `ISNULL(CryptoPositionPnL_TRS, 0) + ISNULL(Total_TRSCrypto, 0)` |
| **LiabilitiesFuturesReal** | `ISNULL(PositionPnLFuturesReal, 0) + ISNULL(TotalRealFutures, 0)` |
| **TotalStockManualPosition** | `TotalStockPositionAmount + TotalStockOrders - TotalMirrorStockPositionAmount` |
| **ManualStockPositionPnL** | `StocksPositionPnL - MirrorStocksPositionPnL` |
| **TotalCryptoManualPosition** | `TotalCryptoPositionAmount - TotalMirrorCryptoPositionAmount` |
| **TotalCryptoManualPosition_TRS** | `TotalCryptoPositionAmount_TRS - TotalMirrorCryptoPositionAmount_TRS` |

---

## 3. Source Objects

| Object | Schema | Alias | Role |
|--------|--------|-------|------|
| Fact_SnapshotEquity | DWH_dbo | a | Equity balances, cash, positions, AUM, credit |
| V_M2M_Date_DateRange | DWH_dbo | b | Expands DateRangeID to per-day rows (DateKey, FullDate) |
| Fact_CustomerUnrealized_PnL | DWH_dbo | c | Unrealized PnL, NOP, notional, commissions, risk |
| Fact_Guru_Copiers | DWH_dbo | gc | **Dead join** — no columns selected. LEFT JOIN preserved from 2021, can be removed. |

## 5. Query Advisory

- **Always filter by DateID** — the view contains the full history of daily snapshots. Unfiltered queries are expensive.
- **Balance formula**: `Liabilities + ActualNWA` or equivalently `ISNULL(RealizedEquity,0) + ISNULL(PositionPnL,0)` (Confluence)
- **TotalCash decomposition**: `TotalCash = Credit + TotalMirrorCash` (Confluence)
- **Today's data is excluded** — the WHERE clause filters `DateKey < today`. This is by design; use yesterday's date.
- **LEFT JOIN to FCUPNL**: PnL columns will be NULL for CIDs with no open positions on a given date. Use ISNULL when aggregating.

## 1. Business Meaning

`Dim_Customer` is the DWH's central customer master table — the single point of reference for all customer attributes in analytics and reporting. It consolidates data from 14+ production staging tables spanning multiple microservices (Customer, BackOffice, Billing, Compliance, STS Audit, UserAPI, SalesForce, ContactVerification) into one denormalized row per customer.

The table follows a Type 1 SCD (Slowly Changing Dimension) pattern: each daily ETL run detects changes across 50+ columns and performs a DELETE/INSERT for modified customers, preserving certain indicator fields (deposit history, avatar, document proofs, Tangany/DLT/EquiLend IDs) that are maintained independently of the core change cycle.

Two UC copies exist:
- **Masked**: `main.dwh.gold_...dim_customer_masked` — PII columns contain masked values, accessible to general analytics
- **Unmasked**: `main.pii_data.gold_...dim_customer` — full PII, restricted access

### Business Usage

- **Regulatory Reporting**: Confluence "Business & Regulatory Undertakings Monitoring Platform" JOINs `Dim_Customer` on CID=RealCID for country, regulation, and status filtering
- **BI Queries**: Nearly every DWH fact table JOINs to Dim_Customer (via CID=RealCID) for customer segmentation
- **Synapse Training**: Confluence "Temporary Tables in Synapse" uses Dim_Customer as a reference example for HASH distribution optimization

### 2.2 ETL Pipeline (SP_Dim_Customer_DL_To_Synapse → SP_Dim_Customer)

```
ORCHESTRATOR (SP_Dim_Customer_DL_To_Synapse):
  1. Load 14 staging/external tables:
     Ext_Dim_Customer_Affiliate, Ext_Dim_Customer_BOCustomer, Ext_Dim_Customer_2FA,
     Ext_Dim_Customer_PhoneCustomer, Ext_Dim_Customer_Customer, Ext_Dim_Customer_Avatars,
     Ext_etoro_Billing_vDeposit, Ext_CustomerFinanceDB_Customer_FirstTimeDeposits,
     Ext_Dim_Customer_ScreeningStatusID, Ext_Dim_Customer_SF_ID, Ext_Dim_Customer_Document,
     Ext_Dim_CustomerStatic, Ext_Dim_Customer_CustomerIdentification, Ext_Dim_Customer_StocksLending
  2. EXEC SP_Dim_Customer

CORE LOGIC (SP_Dim_Customer):
  Step 1: Build #customer — JOIN Ext_Customer_Customer + Ext_BOCustomer
          Compute: IsValidCustomer, IsCreditReportValidCB
          Rename: SerialID→AffiliateID, ManagerID→AccountManagerID, isEmployeeAccount→EmployeeAccount
  Step 2: Detect #new (CIDs not yet in Dim_Customer)
  Step 3: Detect #update (50+ column comparison using ISNULL + COLLATE)
  Step 4: Build #full_list (new OR updated CIDs) with 2FA from Ext_2FA
  Step 5: Preserve #CustomerInitalIndicaton (deposit, avatar, document, Tangany, DLT, phone, FTD fields)
  Step 6: BEGIN TRAN: DELETE matching CIDs → INSERT with preserved indicators
  Step 7: Post-transaction UPDATEs:
          Avatar → HasAvatar, AvatarUploadDate
          Deposit → IsDepositor, FirstDepositDate, FirstDepositAmount, FTD fields
          ScreeningStatusID → from screening service
          SalesForceAccountID → from SF ID map
          Document proofs → IsAddressProof, IsIDProof + expiry dates
          2FA → from audit log
          SubChannelID → from affiliate mapping
          ApexID → from CustomerStatic
          Phone → PhoneNumber, IsPhoneVerified, PhoneVerificationDate
          Tangany → TanganyID, TanganyStatusID
          DLT → DltID, DltStatusID
          StocksLending → EquiLendID, StocksLendingStatusID
  Step 8: Populate Ext_Dim_Customer_ExternalID_GCID, update UserName_Lower
```

## 2. Business Logic

### 4.1 Change Detection (CDC-Style)

The SP compares 50+ columns between `#customer` (staging) and existing `Dim_Customer` using `ISNULL(old,0) <> ISNULL(new,0)` with explicit `COLLATE Latin1_General_100_BIN` for string columns. Only customers with actual changes (or new customers) are processed. This prevents unnecessary row churn.

### 4.2 Indicator Preservation

When a customer row is updated (DELETE+INSERT), certain indicator fields are preserved from the old row via `#CustomerInitalIndicaton`: FirstDepositAmount, FirstDepositDate, HasAvatar, IsDepositor, ScreeningStatusID, SalesForceAccountID, document proofs, WorldCheckID, Tangany, Phone, EquiLend, DLT, FTD fields. These are then refreshed in subsequent post-load UPDATEs if new data is available.

### 4.3 Multi-Source Identity Resolution

Customer attributes come from multiple microservices. The ETL uses `ISNULL(history_version, current_value)` patterns to prefer the latest History version (with temporal filtering: ValidFrom < @CurrentDate, ValidFrom >= @DelayDate, ValidTo >= @CurrentDate) over the current snapshot, ensuring the most up-to-date attribute values are captured.

### 4.4 FTD Recovery Date Logic

The `FirstDepositDate` is updated using: if the existing `FirstDepositDate` (as date) is earlier than `FTDRecoveryDate`, use `FTDRecoveryDate`; otherwise use the `FTDDate`. This handles cases where an FTD was reversed and re-deposited on a different day.

### 4.5 IsValidCustomer Business Rule

```
IsValidCustomer = 1 WHEN:
  PlayerLevelID ≠ 4 (not Popular Investor)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (30, 26) (not bonus-only or specific label)
  AND CountryID ≠ 250
```

This excludes demo-like, internal, and specific-jurisdiction accounts from standard reporting.

## 6. Relationships

### 5.1 Dimension Lookups

| Column | Dimension Table | Join Pattern |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| CountryID / CountryIDByIP / CitizenshipCountryID / POBCountryID | Dim_Country | CountryID = CountryID |
| AffiliateID | Dim_Affiliate | AffiliateID = AffiliateID |
| CampaignID | Dim_Campaign | CampaignID = CampaignID |
| AccountTypeID | Dim_AccountType | AccountTypeID = AccountTypeID |
| AccountStatusID | Dim_AccountStatus | AccountStatusID = AccountStatusID |
| PlayerLevelID | (Dictionary.PlayerLevel — no DWH dim) | — |
| GuruStatusID | Dim_GuruStatus | GuruStatusID = GuruStatusID |
| FunnelID | Dim_Funnel | FunnelID = FunnelID |
| DocumentStatusID | Dim_DocumentStatus | DocumentStatusID = DocumentStatusID |
| EvMatchStatus | Dim_EvMatchStatus | EvMatchStatus = EvMatchStatus |
| CashoutFeeGroupID | Dim_CashoutFeeGroup | CashoutFeeGroupID = CashoutFeeGroupID |

### 5.2 Fact Table Relationships

Nearly every DWH fact table JOINs to Dim_Customer:
- `Fact_BillingWithdraw.CID = Dim_Customer.RealCID`
- `Fact_CustomerUnrealized_PnL.CID = Dim_Customer.RealCID`
- `Fact_SnapshotCustomer.RealCID = Dim_Customer.RealCID`
- `Fact_CustomerAction.CID = Dim_Customer.RealCID`
- `Dim_Position.CID = Dim_Customer.RealCID`

### 5.3 Source Chain

```
Production Microservices                    DWH Staging                         Synapse DWH
──────────────────────                    ──────────                         ───────────
