# Regen Harness — Writer Prompt

# Regen Harness — Writer (single-object mode)

You are running the DWH Semantic Documentation pipeline on **ONE OBJECT** in
isolated regen-harness mode. This is NOT the normal batch loop. You are NOT
reading `_index.md`, NOT updating any index file, NOT processing other
objects, NOT running cross-schema sync. You document one object end-to-end and
exit.

---

## ⛔ MCP PRE-FLIGHT — MANDATORY

Before reading any rule files or DDL:

1. Call `mcp__synapse_sql__execute_sql_read_only` with `SELECT 1 AS mcp_preflight`.
2. **If it fails or the tool does not exist**: print `REGEN ABORT: Synapse MCP unavailable` and **EXIT IMMEDIATELY**. A wiki without live data sampling is INCOMPLETE and WILL FAIL the adversarial judge.
3. **If it succeeds**: print `MCP PRE-FLIGHT: PASS` and continue.

No exceptions. No "code-only documentation" fallback. No "I'll skip Phase 2 because the table looks dormant" — the judge sees the dormant footer too and will fail you for missing data evidence.

---

## ⛔ PRE-RESOLVED UPSTREAM CONTEXT — your Tier 1 inheritance source is below, USE IT

The block titled **"## PRE-RESOLVED UPSTREAM BUNDLE"** in this prompt was
assembled **deterministically by the harness, before you started**. It contains:

- The **DDL** for the object you are documenting (verbatim from SSDT).
- Every **upstream wiki** the harness could resolve from the existing
  `.lineage.md` plus DDL-derived references — both local Synapse wikis and
  remote production-DB wikis (DB_Schema, ExperianceDBs, etc.).
- For any stored procedure mentioned in the lineage, the **SP source code**
  pulled from `DataPlatform\SynapseSQLPool1\sql_dp_prod_we\...`.

**Treat this bundle as your AUTHORITATIVE source for Tier 1 inheritance.** You
are NOT permitted to claim "no upstream wiki could be found" if the bundle
contains one. You ARE permitted to read additional files via the `Read` tool
if you need more context.

### Tier rules — re-stated, NON-NEGOTIABLE

For every column in the object:

1. **Passthrough or rename WITH upstream wiki present in the bundle** →
   **Tier 1**. Description MUST be a verbatim quote from the upstream wiki.
   Do not paraphrase. Do not "improve". Do not generalize vendor names. Do not
   drop NULL semantics. The judge will run a character-by-character
   comparison.
2. **ETL-computed** (CASE / arithmetic / aggregation visible in the SP source) →
   **Tier 2** with the transform stated.
3. **Dim-lookup passthrough** (`SELECT dim.X` with no transform AND `Dim_X`
   has its own Tier 1 origin documented in the bundle) → **Tier 1 with the
   dim's origin** (e.g. `Dictionary.Country`), NOT `Tier 2 via SP_X` and NOT
   `Tier 1 via Dim_X` (Dim_X is a relay, not a root). Quote the dim's wiki
   verbatim.
4. **No source traceable from bundle, DDL, JOINs, or SP source** →
   **Tier 3** with explicit reason. Be specific: "PII column, no upstream wiki
   located, name suggests …".
5. **`Tier 4 — inferred from name`** is BANNED unless the bundle explicitly
   shows the column has no upstream and no SP code touches it. Lazy Tier 4 is
   the #1 reason wikis fail the judge. If you are tempted to write Tier 4
   with no other evidence, you have skipped Phase 9 — go back and read the
   SP source in the bundle.

### Footer rules

- If the bundle contains AT LEAST ONE upstream wiki: the footer MUST identify
  the production source(s). Writing `Production Source: Unknown (dormant)`
  when the bundle proves an upstream exists is an automatic fail.
- If `_no_upstream_found.txt` exists in the regen folder: it is OK to mark
  the table as dormant in the footer, but you MUST still ground every column
  description in the DDL + SP code rather than `Tier 4 — inferred`.

---

## Output paths — write here, NOT into the main wiki tree

Write all THREE output files into:

```
audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/
  {Object}.md
  {Object}.lineage.md
  {Object}.review-needed.md
```

`{Schema}`, `{Object}`, and `{N}` are passed in via the prompt header below.

**DO NOT** write into `knowledge/synapse/Wiki/` under any circumstances. The
main tree is read-only for this run. **DO NOT** modify `_index.md` or any
`_batch_context.json`. **DO NOT** generate `.alter.sql`. **DO NOT** run Phase
16 — the adversarial judge runs as a separate, fresh claude process AFTER you
exit. Pretending to evaluate yourself wastes tokens.

---

## Pipeline scope for this single object

Run phases 1 through 11 inclusive. Skip Phase 16. Skip Phase 11W (no ALTER).
Skip cross-object index updates. Skip `_batch_context.json` writes.

Required phase gates (you must print them as you complete each):

```
PHASE GATE — {Schema}.{Object}:
  [x] P1 DDL          [x] P2 Sample        [x] P3 Dist
  [x] P4 Lookup       [x] P5 JOIN          [x] P6 BizLogic
  [x] P7 Views        [x] P8 SP-scan       [x] P9 SP-logic
  [x] P9B ETL         [x] P10 Jira         [x] P10A Upstream
  [x] P10B Lineage    → Ready for P11
```

If a phase truly cannot run (e.g. no SPs reference the table), mark it `[-]`
with a one-line reason. Skipping P2 or P3 because "the table is small" is
NOT a valid reason — sample it.

---

## Outputs — three files, exact shape

Follow the GOLDEN-REFERENCE in
`.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/GOLDEN-REFERENCE.mdc`.

1. **`{Object}.lineage.md`** — written FIRST (Phase 10B). Source Objects
   table + Column Lineage table. Every Tier 1 row must point to a file in the
   pre-resolved bundle (or to a wiki you read independently).
2. **`{Object}.md`** — the main wiki, 8 sections, every column in
   Section 4's Elements table, every description ending with
   `(Tier N — source)`.
3. **`{Object}.review-needed.md`** — items needing human review. MUST NOT
   contain a `## 4. Elements` section.

---

## Final checklist before exiting

Print, verbatim:

```
OUTPUT CHECK — {Schema}.{Object}:
  [x] .lineage.md    written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.lineage.md
  [x] .md            written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.md
  [x] .review-needed.md written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.review-needed.md
  [-] .alter.sql     deferred (regen harness — judge runs next)
  Tier1 columns: N    Tier2: N    Tier3: N    Tier4: N
  Bundle inheritance used: YES/NO  (NO is only valid if `_no_upstream_found.txt` exists)
```

Then EXIT. Do not run a self-evaluation. Do not "double-check by re-reading
the wiki you just wrote". Do not append a verdict block. The judge runs in a
separate process with its own context.

# build-wiki-bidb-batch

You are running the DWH Semantic Documentation pipeline for schema BI_DB_dbo.
**Wiki-only mode** — generate documentation files only. ALTER scripts are generated separately later via `/generate-alter-dwh`.

## ⛔ MCP PRE-FLIGHT — NON-NEGOTIABLE, CHECK BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

Before loading rules, before reading the index, before planning anything:

1. **Test Synapse MCP**: Call `mcp__synapse_sql__execute_sql_read_only` with `SELECT 1 AS mcp_preflight`
2. **If it fails or the tool does not exist**: Print `BATCH ABORT: Synapse MCP unavailable` and **EXIT IMMEDIATELY**. Do NOT proceed. Do NOT fall back to "prior batch context data". Do NOT use a "schema practice" of skipping MCP. A wiki without live data sampling is INCOMPLETE and WILL NOT PASS the adversarial evaluator. STOP HERE.
3. **If it succeeds**: Print `MCP PRE-FLIGHT: PASS` and continue to Instructions.

There is NO exception to this rule. No "prior context", no "code-only documentation", no "graceful degradation". MCP down = batch aborted. Period.

---

## Instructions (regen-harness, single object)

1. **Load rules** — read these in order before anything else:
   - `.cursor/rules/semantic-layer-core/repo-first-access.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/00-execution-card.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/mcp-query-rules.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/GOLDEN-REFERENCE.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/10.5b-tier1-enforcement.mdc`

2. **Skip batch planning** — do NOT read `_index.md`, do NOT touch
   `_batch_context.json`, do NOT scan the blacklist. The harness
   already chose this object.

3. **Run the pipeline for THIS object only**: phases 1 through 11
   inclusive. Use the pre-resolved upstream bundle (provided below)
   as your authoritative Tier 1 source. Generate three files in
   `audits/regen-sample/{schema}/{object}/regen/attempt_{N}/`:
   `.lineage.md`, `.md`, `.review-needed.md`. Do NOT generate
   `.alter.sql`. Do NOT modify any file under `knowledge/synapse/Wiki/`.

4. **Skip Phase 16** — the adversarial judge runs in a separate,
   fresh claude process after you exit. Self-evaluation here wastes
   tokens and pollutes the comparison.

5. **Exit cleanly** after printing the OUTPUT CHECK block defined in
   the Regen Harness preamble.

## Upstream Wikis Found

Found 9 upstream wiki(s). Read EACH one in full.


### Upstream `DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer` — synapse
- **Resolved as**: `DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer`
- **Wiki path**: `C:\Users\guyman\Documents\github\Databricks_Knowledge\knowledge\synapse\Wiki\DWH_dbo\Tables\Dim_Customer.md`

﻿# DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer

> Master customer dimension table for the DWH; consolidates identity, demographics, compliance status, acquisition tracking, and external integrations from 14+ staging sources into a single slowly-changing Type 1 dimension with explicit change detection, PII masking, and multi-phase post-load enrichment.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Schema** | DWH_dbo |
| **Object Type** | Table (Dimension) |
| **Key Identifier** | RealCID (PK NOT ENFORCED, CLUSTERED INDEX, HASH distribution key) |
| **Distribution** | HASH(RealCID) |
| **Index** | CLUSTERED INDEX (RealCID ASC); PK NONCLUSTERED NOT ENFORCED |
| **Column Count** | 107 |
| **PII Masking** | 14 columns with Dynamic Data Masking |
| **Synapse Pool** | sql_dp_prod_we |
| **UC Tables** | `main.dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_customer_masked` (masked), `main.pii_data.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_customer` (unmasked PII) |
| **UC Copy Strategy** | Override |
| **Refresh** | Daily (1440 min) |
| **ETL Pattern** | CDC-style: change detection → DELETE/INSERT → multi-phase UPDATE enrichment |

## 1. Business Meaning

`Dim_Customer` is the DWH's central customer master table — the single point of reference for all customer attributes in analytics and reporting. It consolidates data from 14+ production staging tables spanning multiple microservices (Customer, BackOffice, Billing, Compliance, STS Audit, UserAPI, SalesForce, ContactVerification) into one denormalized row per customer.

The table follows a Type 1 SCD (Slowly Changing Dimension) pattern: each daily ETL run detects changes across 50+ columns and performs a DELETE/INSERT for modified customers, preserving certain indicator fields (deposit history, avatar, document proofs, Tangany/DLT/EquiLend IDs) that are maintained independently of the core change cycle.

Two UC copies exist:
- **Masked**: `main.dwh.gold_...dim_customer_masked` — PII columns contain masked values, accessible to general analytics
- **Unmasked**: `main.pii_data.gold_...dim_customer` — full PII, restricted access

### Business Usage

- **Regulatory Reporting**: Confluence "Business & Regulatory Undertakings Monitoring Platform" JOINs `Dim_Customer` on CID=RealCID for country, regulation, and status filtering
- **BI Queries**: Nearly every DWH fact table JOINs to Dim_Customer (via CID=RealCID) for customer segmentation
- **Synapse Training**: Confluence "Temporary Tables in Synapse" uses Dim_Customer as a reference example for HASH distribution optimization

### 2.2 ETL Pipeline (SP_Dim_Customer_DL_To_Synapse → SP_Dim_Customer)

```
ORCHESTRATOR (SP_Dim_Customer_DL_To_Synapse):
  1. Load 14 staging/external tables:
     Ext_Dim_Customer_Affiliate, Ext_Dim_Customer_BOCustomer, Ext_Dim_Customer_2FA,
     Ext_Dim_Customer_PhoneCustomer, Ext_Dim_Customer_Customer, Ext_Dim_Customer_Avatars,
     Ext_etoro_Billing_vDeposit, Ext_CustomerFinanceDB_Customer_FirstTimeDeposits,
     Ext_Dim_Customer_ScreeningStatusID, Ext_Dim_Customer_SF_ID, Ext_Dim_Customer_Document,
     Ext_Dim_CustomerStatic, Ext_Dim_Customer_CustomerIdentification, Ext_Dim_Customer_StocksLending
  2. EXEC SP_Dim_Customer

CORE LOGIC (SP_Dim_Customer):
  Step 1: Build #customer — JOIN Ext_Customer_Customer + Ext_BOCustomer
          Compute: IsValidCustomer, IsCreditReportValidCB
          Rename: SerialID→AffiliateID, ManagerID→AccountManagerID, isEmployeeAccount→EmployeeAccount
  Step 2: Detect #new (CIDs not yet in Dim_Customer)
  Step 3: Detect #update (50+ column comparison using ISNULL + COLLATE)
  Step 4: Build #full_list (new OR updated CIDs) with 2FA from Ext_2FA
  Step 5: Preserve #CustomerInitalIndicaton (deposit, avatar, document, Tangany, DLT, phone, FTD fields)
  Step 6: BEGIN TRAN: DELETE matching CIDs → INSERT with preserved indicators
  Step 7: Post-transaction UPDATEs:
          Avatar → HasAvatar, AvatarUploadDate
          Deposit → IsDepositor, FirstDepositDate, FirstDepositAmount, FTD fields
          ScreeningStatusID → from screening service
          SalesForceAccountID → from SF ID map
          Document proofs → IsAddressProof, IsIDProof + expiry dates
          2FA → from audit log
          SubChannelID → from affiliate mapping
          ApexID → from CustomerStatic
          Phone → PhoneNumber, IsPhoneVerified, PhoneVerificationDate
          Tangany → TanganyID, TanganyStatusID
          DLT → DltID, DltStatusID
          StocksLending → EquiLendID, StocksLendingStatusID
  Step 8: Populate Ext_Dim_Customer_ExternalID_GCID, update UserName_Lower
```

### 2.3 Key Column Renames

| DWH Column | Source Column | Source Table | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| RealCID | CID | etoro_Customer_Customer | Disambiguate from other CID uses in DWH |
| AffiliateID | SerialID | etoro_Customer_Customer | Business-friendly name |
| AccountManagerID | ManagerID | etoro_BackOffice_Customer | Disambiguate from other ManagerID columns |
| EmployeeAccount | isEmployeeAccount | etoro_BackOffice_Customer | Normalize casing |
| RegisteredReal | Registered | etoro_Customer_Customer | Clarify real-account registration |

### 2.4 DWH-Computed Columns

| Column | Computation |
|--------|------------|
| IsValidCustomer | `1` when PlayerLevelID≠4 AND LabelID NOT IN (30,26) AND CountryID≠250; else `0` |
| IsCreditReportValidCB | Similar to IsValidCustomer but also excludes PlayerLevelID=4 when AccountTypeID≠2, and has specific CID exceptions for CountryID=250 |
| UpdateDate | `GETDATE()` — ETL timestamp |
| UserName_Lower | `LOWER(UserName)` — set in final UPDATE |

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 4.1 Change Detection (CDC-Style)

The SP compares 50+ columns between `#customer` (staging) and existing `Dim_Customer` using `ISNULL(old,0) <> ISNULL(new,0)` with explicit `COLLATE Latin1_General_100_BIN` for string columns. Only customers with actual changes (or new customers) are processed. This prevents unnecessary row churn.

### 4.2 Indicator Preservation

When a customer row is updated (DELETE+INSERT), certain indicator fields are preserved from the old row via `#CustomerInitalIndicaton`: FirstDepositAmount, FirstDepositDate, HasAvatar, IsDepositor, ScreeningStatusID, SalesForceAccountID, document proofs, WorldCheckID, Tangany, Phone, EquiLend, DLT, FTD fields. These are then refreshed in subsequent post-load UPDATEs if new data is available.

### 4.3 Multi-Source Identity Resolution

Customer attributes come from multiple microservices. The ETL uses `ISNULL(history_version, current_value)` patterns to prefer the latest History version (with temporal filtering: ValidFrom < @CurrentDate, ValidFrom >= @DelayDate, ValidTo >= @CurrentDate) over the current snapshot, ensuring the most up-to-date attribute values are captured.

### 4.4 FTD Recovery Date Logic

The `FirstDepositDate` is updated using: if the existing `FirstDepositDate` (as date) is earlier than `FTDRecoveryDate`, use `FTDRecoveryDate`; otherwise use the `FTDDate`. This handles cases where an FTD was reversed and re-deposited on a different day.

### 4.5 IsValidCustomer Business Rule

```
IsValidCustomer = 1 WHEN:
  PlayerLevelID ≠ 4 (not Popular Investor)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (30, 26) (not bonus-only or specific label)
  AND CountryID ≠ 250
```

This excludes demo-like, internal, and specific-jurisdiction accounts from standard reporting.

## 1. Business Meaning

Fact_SnapshotCustomer is the central customer state table in the DWH. For every eToro customer (RealCID), it holds one row per distinct attribute state within a year, recording which attributes were active between FromDate and ToDate (encoded together in `DateRangeID`). The pattern is SCD Type 2 by year: each year's rows are closed as attribute changes occur, and a new open row is created with the updated state. At year-end, all open rows are closed and reopened with the new year's date range.

As of 2026-03-19: **406M+ total rows**, **46.4M distinct customers**, data from **2007-08-22 to present**. 302M rows are "currently open" (ToDate = year-end). 11.9% of current open rows represent depositors; 98.0% are valid customers (IsValidCustomer=1).

The SP loads data from 6 source systems via staging Ext_FSC tables pre-populated by SP_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_DL_To_Synapse. The core CC (Customer Core) source provides demographics and status; the BO (Back Office) source provides risk/compliance attributes. RegulationID is taken from RegulationChangeLog — **not** from Back Office — because regulation changes take effect end-of-day.

8 legacy columns (DemoCID, CustomerChangeTypeID, CurentValue, PreviousValue, DocsOK, Bankruptcy, PremiumAccount, Evangelist) are present in the DDL but NOT populated by the current SP. They carry DEFAULT (0) values.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 SCD Type 2 Pattern — DateRangeID

**What**: Each customer-state row has a DateRangeID encoding both the open date (FromDate) and close date (ToDate) as a 12-digit bigint.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `RealCID`

**Rules**:
- DateRangeID = `YYYYMMDD` (open date, 8 chars) + `MMDDD` (year-end month+day, 4 chars) → e.g., `202603101231` = opened 2026-03-10, closes 2026-12-31
- When an attribute changes, the SP updates DateRangeID of the existing row to close it (right 4 chars become yesterday's MMDD), then inserts a new row with today's open date + year-end
- To get the **most current row** per customer: `RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4) = '1231'`
- On January 1st: all prior year's open rows are closed (12-31) and re-opened for the new year
- The `Dim_Range` dimension table stores FromDateID + ToDateID for each DateRangeID

### 2.2 IsValidCustomer — Segment Flag

**What**: Computed flag indicating whether a customer is a "valid" retail customer for analytics (excludes demo, blocked countries, excluded labels).

**Columns Involved**: `IsValidCustomer`, `PlayerLevelID`, `LabelID`, `CountryID`

**Rules** (as of post-2020-03-14):
```
IsValidCustomer = 1 IF:
  PlayerLevelID <> 4 (not demo)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (30, 26) (not internal/excluded label)
  AND CountryID <> 250 (not blocked country)
ELSE 0
```
Pre-2020-03-14 rule additionally excluded AccountTypeID=9.

### 2.3 IsCreditReportValidCB — Credit Reporting Flag

**What**: Flag indicating whether a customer is eligible for credit report validation (CB = CreditBureau context).

**Columns Involved**: `IsCreditReportValidCB`, `PlayerLevelID`, `AccountTypeID`, `LabelID`, `CountryID`

**Rules** (as of post-2020-03-14):
```
IsCreditReportValidCB = 1 IF:
  NOT (PlayerLevelID = 4 AND AccountTypeID <> 2)  (not non-real demo)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (26, 30)
  AND NOT (CountryID = 250 AND CID NOT IN (3400616, 10526243))
ELSE 0
```

### 2.4 RegulationID — End-of-Day Rule

**What**: A customer's regulatory jurisdiction is taken from RegulationChangeLog (end-of-day change), NOT from the back-office system (immediate change), because regulation changes take effect at end of day for business/legal reasons.

**Columns Involved**: `RegulationID`, sourced from `Ext_FSC_BackOffice_RegulationChangeLog.ToRegulationID`

### 2.5 GDPR Erasure Masking

**What**: When a GDPR deletion request is processed, the UserName in Customer Core gets a `DelUserName` prefix. The SP detects this and masks Email, City, Address, Zip, and PhoneNumber in Fact_SnapshotCustomer.

**Columns Involved**: `Email`, `City`, `Address`, `Zip`, `PhoneNumber`

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, HASH(RealCID) distribution + CCI makes per-customer aggregations and filters on RealCID highly efficient — queries that filter or join on RealCID benefit from colocation. The NCI on RealCID provides efficient point-lookup for single customers.

**Warning**: With 406M rows, full table scans are expensive. Always filter by DateRangeID or a specific year range when possible.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage

**In Databricks**, the data is accessed via `V_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_FromDateID` (generic_id=1115), not directly. Two UC targets:
- `pii_data.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_v_fact_snapshotcustomer_fromdateid` — full PII (gated access)
- `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_v_fact_snapshotcustomer_fromdateid_masked` — Email/City/Address/Zip masked

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Current state for all customers | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` |
| Current state for one customer | `WHERE RealCID = @cid AND RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` |
| Customer state on a specific date | `WHERE RealCID = @cid AND LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),8) <= @date AND RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) >= RIGHT(@date, 4)` |
| Count of depositors | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231' AND IsDepositor = 1` |
| Valid retail customers | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231' AND IsValidCustomer = 1` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Country | ON f.CountryID = dc.CountryID | Country name/region |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Label | ON f.LabelID = dl.LabelID | Brand/label name |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Language | ON f.LanguageID = dl.LanguageID | Customer language |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_VerificationLevel | ON f.VerificationLevelID = dv.VerificationLevelID | KYC verification status |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_PlayerStatus | ON f.PlayerStatusID = dp.PlayerStatusID | Account lifecycle status |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Regulation | ON f.RegulationID = dr.RegulationID | Regulatory jurisdiction |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_AccountStatus | ON f.AccountStatusID = das.AccountStatusID | Account enabled/disabled |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Range | ON f.DateRangeID = dr.DateRangeID | Decode FromDateID + ToDateID |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_Guru_Copiers | ON f.RealCID = fg.RealCID | Copy-trading activity |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **DateRangeID is NOT a date** — it is a 12-digit bigint encoding (FromDate)(ToDate MMDD). Always extract with LEFT(...,8) for FromDate and RIGHT(...,4) for ToDate MMDD.
- **Most-current-row filter**: `RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` gets the currently open row, but after year-end closure this may temporarily return 0 rows. Use `MAX(DateRangeID)` per RealCID as a safer alternative.
- **Legacy columns with 0 defaults**: DemoCID, CustomerChangeTypeID, CurentValue, PreviousValue, DocsOK, Bankruptcy, PremiumAccount, Evangelist are all DEFAULT 0 and NOT populated by the current SP. Do not rely on them.
- **PII masking**: Email, City, Address, Zip are dynamically masked (`MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'default()')`). Users without `UNMASK` permission see NULL. PhoneNumber is NOT masked at DDL level but is GDPR-erased via the SP for deleted users.
- **WeekendFeePrecentage** (note: typo in column name — "Precentage" instead of "Percentage") — use as-is.
- **AccountStatusID distribution**: 1=93.2% (Active), 0=6.1% (unknown/default), 2=0.9% (Inactive). Only 3 distinct values observed.
- **Not exported directly to UC** — join via `V_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_FromDateID` in UC.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_Range is a DWH-internal helper lookup that pre-computes all possible (FromDate, ToDate) date range pairs needed by the Snapshot analytics pipelines. Each row represents a unique start-to-end date interval, identified by a composite BigInt key (DateRangeID). The table enables efficient range-based JOINs in SnapshotEquity and SnapshotCustomer views without requiring date arithmetic at query time.

This table has no external production source. It is generated entirely within the DWH by SP_Fact_SnapshotEquity and SP_Fact_SnapshotCustomer, which INSERT new DateRangeID combinations as they encounter new date pairs during snapshot processing. The pattern is append-only - new rows are added daily but existing rows are never updated or deleted.

As of 2026-03-10, the table contains approximately 1.3 million date range pairs spanning from 2007-01-01 to 2026-03-10 on the FromDate side, and 2007-08-26 to 2026-12-31 on the ToDate side.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 DateRangeID Encoding

**What**: DateRangeID is a deterministic composite key encoding both FromDate and MMDD(ToDate) into a single 12-digit BigInt.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `FromDateID`, `ToDateID`

**Rules**:
- Formula: `DateRangeID = CONCAT(YYYYMMDD(FromDate), MMDD(ToDate))`
- Example: FromDateID=20070101, ToDateID=20071231 -> DateRangeID=200701011231
- Decoding FromDateID: `CONVERT(INT, LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 8))`
- Decoding ToDateID: `CONVERT(INT, LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4) + RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4))`
- The YEAR component of ToDateID is always the SAME as the YEAR of FromDateID (only MMDD of ToDate is stored in the last 4 digits)

**Diagram**:
```
DateRangeID (12-digit BigInt):
  [ YYYY | MM | DD | MM | DD ]
  [  From Year  | From MMDD  | To MMDD ]
   |___________|             |________|
   Chars 1-8 = FromDateID    Chars 9-12 = MMDD(ToDate)

  ToDateID = YYYY(FromDate) + MMDD(ToDate)
  -> Year-end range example:
     FromDate=2020-03-15, ToDate=2020-12-31
     DateRangeID = 202003151231
     ToDateID    = 20201231
```

### 2.2 Snapshot Range Pattern

**What**: Dim_Range is the bridge between individual customer dates and fiscal/calendar year-end periods in Snapshot reports.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `FromDateID`, `ToDateID`

**Rules**:
- The primary use case is "from customer registration/event date to year-end": FromDate = customer's start date, ToDate = December 31 of that year
- The SPs also generate non-year-end ranges when snapshots require partial-period measurements
- The table grows daily as new snapshot dates are processed
- No deduplication needed - DateRangeID uniqueness is enforced by the NOT EXISTS check in both SPs

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with a composite CLUSTERED INDEX on (DateRangeID, FromDateID, ToDateID) and three Non-Clustered Indexes: IX_Dim_Range_FromDateID, IX_Dim_Range_ToDateID, and IX_Dim_Range_FromDateID_ToDateID. The NCI indexes are unusual for Synapse (which typically uses only CCI) and suggest heavy range-based lookups by the Snapshot SPs. Always filter on FromDateID or ToDateID directly to leverage these indexes.

Note: PRIMARY KEY (DateRangeID) is declared NOT ENFORCED - Synapse does not validate uniqueness but the ETL SPs maintain it via NOT EXISTS guards.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, the Gold export at `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_range` is Parquet. With 1.3M rows, consider filtering on FromDateID for performance.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|

| DWH_dbo.V_M2M_Date_DateRange | DateRangeID | Month-to-month date range bridging |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **ToDate YEAR = FromDate YEAR**: The DateRangeID encoding only stores MMDD of ToDate. The year of ToDate is derived from FromDate's year. This means all ranges in this table are within-year ranges - cross-year ranges cannot be represented.
- **INSERT-only, no TRUNCATE**: Both writer SPs use NOT EXISTS guards, making the table append-only. Rows are never deleted. If a DateRangeID is erroneously created, it persists forever.
- **Primary key NOT ENFORCED**: Synapse does not verify uniqueness of DateRangeID. Trust the ETL logic, not the constraint.
- **DateRangeID is a STRING-derived number**: Always treat DateRangeID as a derived key, not a business ID. Decode using LEFT/RIGHT string operations if needed.
- **1.3M rows for a dim table**: Larger than typical dimensions. REPLICATE is appropriate given daily Snapshot SP joins from all distributions.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_PlayerLevel defines the eToro Club loyalty program tiers that segment customers by their realized equity (account value). Each tier grants progressively better benefits: faster cashout processing, higher service priority, and dedicated account management. The tiers in ascending rank are: Bronze -> Silver -> Gold -> Platinum -> Platinum Plus -> Diamond, plus a special Internal tier for employee/test accounts.

The data originates from `etoro.Dictionary.PlayerLevel` on the etoroDB-REAL production SQL Server. The Generic Pipeline exports this table daily (Override strategy) to `Bronze/etoro/Dictionary/PlayerLevel/` in the data lake. Production has 7 active tier rows (IDs 1-7); DWH adds a synthetic ID=0 N/A placeholder.

**CRITICAL SCHEMA DRIFT**: The DWH ETL loads only 8 of the production's 13 columns. The following production columns are DROPPED and not available in DWH: `RealizedEquityFrom`, `RealizedEquityTo` (the primary tier qualification thresholds), `IsWalletRedeemAllowed`, `ThresholdPercentToCurrentLevel`, and `DaysInRiskBeforeDowngrade`. For tier qualification logic, query the upstream `etoro.Dictionary.PlayerLevel` directly or the upstream wiki. The DWH table is suitable only for resolving tier names and cashout hours -- not for equity-based tier evaluation.

Loaded by `SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse` via TRUNCATE + INSERT from staging, followed by a separate INSERT VALUES for the ID=0 N/A sentinel using `@ddate` (midnight timestamp). Refreshes daily.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Tier Hierarchy and Rank Order

**What**: Six customer-facing loyalty tiers plus one internal tier, ranked by realized equity.

**Columns Involved**: `PlayerLevelID`, `Name`, `Sort`

**Rules**:
- IDs are NOT in rank order -- use `Sort` column for display ordering.
- Sort order: 0=Internal (excluded), 1=Bronze, 2=Silver, 3=Gold, 4=Platinum, 5=Platinum Plus, 6=Diamond.
- Internal (ID=4) is excluded from customer-facing reports: `WHERE PlayerLevelID <> 4`.
- ID=0 (N/A) is a DWH-only ETL placeholder for NULL FK safety. Not in production.

**Diagram**:
```
Tier Hierarchy (by Sort/Rank):
  Sort 1 = Bronze     (ID=1) -- entry level
  Sort 2 = Silver     (ID=5)
  Sort 3 = Gold       (ID=3)
  Sort 4 = Platinum   (ID=2)
  Sort 5 = Platinum + (ID=6)
  Sort 6 = Diamond    (ID=7) -- top tier
  Sort 0 = Internal   (ID=4) -- excluded
  (ID=0  = N/A       -- DWH ETL placeholder)
```

### 2.2 Cashout Processing Speed by Tier

**What**: Higher tiers receive priority cashout processing as a loyalty benefit.

**Columns Involved**: `CashoutPendingHours`

**Rules**:
- **120 hours (5 days)**: Bronze (1), Silver (5), Internal (4), N/A (0)
- **72 hours (3 days)**: Gold (3)
- **24 hours (1 day)**: Platinum (2), Platinum Plus (6), Diamond (7)
- This is one of the most impactful benefits of upper tier membership.

### 2.3 Legacy Lot/Deposit Thresholds (Deprecated)

**What**: Historical tier qualification fields -- superseded by RealizedEquity (not in DWH).

**Columns Involved**: `FromSumLotCount`, `ToSumLotCount`, `FromSumDeposit`, `ToSumDeposit`

**Rules**:
- All set to `-1` for Platinum (2), Platinum Plus (6), Diamond (7) -- meaning "disabled/not applicable".
- Bronze (1) has 1-3000 lots, $0-$999 deposit; Silver (5) has 3001-20000 lots, $1000-$4999; Gold (3) has 20001-100000 lots, $5000-$19999.
- These columns are legacy artifacts. The current tier system uses `RealizedEquityFrom/To` which are NOT loaded into DWH.
- Value -1 = "threshold disabled -- upper tier, equity-based qualification only".

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with a HEAP index. HEAP (no clustering) is unusual for dimension tables -- most Dim_ tables use CLUSTERED INDEX. With only 8 rows, HEAP is not a concern for performance but means scans are unordered. Always use `ORDER BY Sort` for consistent tier display.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, this table lands as `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_playerlevel`. With 8 rows, no partitioning or Z-ORDER is needed.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| What tier is a customer in? | JOIN Dim_Customer ON PlayerLevelID for Name |
| Tier distribution of customer base | GROUP BY PlayerLevelID, exclude Internal (ID=4) |
| Display tiers in rank order | ORDER BY Sort ASC, exclude ID=0 and ID=4 |
| Cashout processing time for a tier | SELECT CashoutPendingHours WHERE PlayerLevelID = X |
| What are the equity thresholds? | NOT available in DWH -- use upstream wiki or prod data |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON dc.PlayerLevelID = dpl.PlayerLevelID | Resolve tier name per customer |
| DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer | ON vdc.PlayerLevelID = dpl.PlayerLevelID | View-level tier resolution |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer | ON fsc.PlayerLevelID = dpl.PlayerLevelID | Tier in daily snapshots |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **IDs are NOT in rank order**: PlayerLevelID 2=Platinum, 3=Gold, 5=Silver. Always use `Sort` for ordering tiers. Filtering `PlayerLevelID > 3` does NOT mean "higher than Gold".
- **Internal tier (ID=4)**: Must be excluded in most customer analytics: `WHERE PlayerLevelID <> 4` or `WHERE PlayerLevelID NOT IN (0, 4)`.
- **-1 in range columns means disabled**: For Platinum/Platinum Plus/Diamond, FromSumLotCount=-1 and ToSumLotCount=-1 indicate the legacy lot-count threshold is not used. Do NOT interpret -1 as a valid lot count.
- **Critical columns missing from DWH**: `RealizedEquityFrom`, `RealizedEquityTo`, `DaysInRiskBeforeDowngrade`, `ThresholdPercentToCurrentLevel`, and `IsWalletRedeemAllowed` are ALL in production but NOT in DWH. For equity-tier evaluation, use the upstream source.
- **HEAP index**: Unlike most DWH Dim_ tables, this uses HEAP (no CCI). Row order is not guaranteed without explicit ORDER BY.
- **ID=0 midnight timestamp**: The N/A placeholder (ID=0) has midnight InsertDate/UpdateDate from `@ddate = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)`, while production rows have full timestamps from GETDATE().

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_PlayerStatus defines 16 distinct account restriction states in the eToro platform, each encoding a granular permission matrix controlling what a user can and cannot do. Unlike Dim_AccountStatus (binary open/closed), PlayerStatus provides fine-grained control over trading, deposits, withdrawals, social features, and copy-trading. This enables compliance and fraud teams to surgically restrict specific capabilities without full account lockout.

The data originates from `etoro.Dictionary.PlayerStatus` on the etoroDB-REAL production SQL Server. The Generic Pipeline exports this table daily (Override) to the data lake, and `SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse` loads it via TRUNCATE + INSERT, plus a separate sentinel INSERT for ID=0 (N/A placeholder). The ETL adds 4 computed columns (DWHPlayerStatusID, StatusID, UpdateDate, InsertDate) and **drops 2 production columns** (`CanCopy` and `GetsInterest`).

PlayerStatusID is stored in Dim_Customer and is read by virtually every user-facing operation -- login, trading, funding, social posting, and copy-trading -- to enforce permission checks. The permission flags are queried directly from this table rather than hardcoded in business logic.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Permission Matrix System

**What**: Each player status defines a complete set of boolean permissions that gate platform features.

**Columns Involved**: `IsBlocked`, `CanEditPosition`, `CanOpenPosition`, `CanClosePosition`, `CanDeposit`, `CanRequestWithdraw`, `CanLogin`, `CanChatAndPost`, `CanBeCopied`

**Rules**:
- **Full Block** (IsBlocked=1): IDs 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 14 -- user cannot log in. All capabilities disabled.
- **Partial Restriction**: IDs 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 -- user can access some features but not others.
- **Full Access**: IDs 1, 5 -- all capabilities enabled. ID=5 (Warning) is identical to Normal in permissions but signals compliance flagging.
- **Close-Only / Wind-Down**: IDs 9 (Trade & MIMO Blocked) and 15 (Block Deposit & Trading) -- user can close existing positions and log in, but cannot open new positions or deposit.

**Diagram**:
```
Access Level Summary:
  ID=1  Normal                -- All capabilities ON
  ID=5  Warning               -- All ON + compliance flag
  ID=3  Chat Blocked          -- All ON except CanChatAndPost
  ID=10 Deposit Blocked       -- All ON except CanDeposit
  ID=12 Copy Block            -- All ON except CanBeCopied (note: DWH lacks CanCopy col)
  ID=9  Trade & MIMO Blocked  -- Close+Login only; no open/deposit/withdraw
  ID=13 Pending Verification  -- Close+Login only
  ID=15 Block Deposit&Trading -- Close+Login+Chat+Copy; no open/deposit
  ID=11 Social Index          -- All ON except CanDeposit + CanRequestWithdraw
  ID=2  Blocked               -- ALL OFF (full lockout, cannot login)
  ID=4  Blocked Upon Request  -- ALL OFF (self-requested lockout)
  ID=6  Under Investigation   -- ALL OFF (compliance hold)
  ID=7  Scalpers Block        -- ALL OFF (trading abuse)
  ID=8  PayPal Investigation  -- ALL OFF (payment fraud)
  ID=14 Failed Verification   -- ALL OFF (KYC failure)
  ID=0  N/A                   -- All OFF (DWH ETL placeholder)
```

### 2.2 Status Transition Patterns

**What**: Common pathways between player statuses driven by compliance, fraud, and user lifecycle events.

**Columns Involved**: `PlayerStatusID`

**Rules**:
- New accounts: 1 (Normal) or 13 (Pending Verification) depending on regulation
- Compliance investigation: 1 -> 6 (Under Investigation) -> 1 (cleared) or 2 (blocked)
- KYC timeout: 13 (Pending) -> 14 (Failed Verification) if docs not submitted
- Self-service closure: 1 -> 4 (Blocked Upon Request)
- Scalping detection: 1 -> 7 (Scalpers Block)
- PayPal fraud: 1 -> 8 (PayPal Investigation)
- Wind-down: 1 -> 9 or 15 (close-only mode for accounts under investigation)

### 2.3 Schema Drift -- Dropped Production Columns

**What**: Two production permission columns are not loaded into DWH.

**Dropped**:
- `CanCopy` (bit, default 1) -- whether user can copy other traders. Status 12 (Copy Block) sets this to 0.
- `GetsInterest` (bit) -- whether overnight fees/credits apply to user's positions. NOT available in DWH.

**Impact**: Analysts cannot determine from DWH whether a given status blocks copy-trading (CanCopy) or overnight interest (GetsInterest). For these, query production or the upstream wiki.

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with a HEAP index. HEAP means no CCI/sort -- for 16 rows this is irrelevant to performance, but row order is arbitrary without ORDER BY. Always join on `PlayerStatusID`. With REPLICATE, JOINs are zero-cost (all nodes have a full copy).

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, no partitioning needed. Full scan of 16 rows is trivial.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resolve a PlayerStatusID to a name | JOIN Dim_PlayerStatus ON PlayerStatusID |
| Find customers who cannot trade | JOIN Dim_Customer, filter CanOpenPosition = 0 or IsBlocked = 1 |
| Count customers by restriction category | GROUP BY IsBlocked + CanOpenPosition combination |
| Find wind-down accounts (close-only) | Filter CanClosePosition = 1 AND CanOpenPosition = 0 |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON dc.PlayerStatusID = dps.PlayerStatusID | Resolve status name and permission flags per customer |
| DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer | ON vdc.PlayerStatusID = dps.PlayerStatusID | View-level status resolution |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer | ON fsc.PlayerStatusID = dps.PlayerStatusID | Customer status in daily snapshots |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **HEAP index**: Like Dim_PlayerLevel, this table uses HEAP. No guaranteed row order without ORDER BY.
- **ID=0 sentinel**: All permission bits are 0 for ID=0 (N/A). LEFT JOIN if the fact table may have NULL or missing PlayerStatusID.
- **CanCopy and GetsInterest are MISSING**: These two production columns are not in DWH. Analysts needing copy-block or interest-eligibility logic must use production data.
- **Status 5 (Warning) = same permissions as Status 1 (Normal)**: All permission flags are identical. The only difference is the compliance signal encoded in the ID itself.
- **Status names have trailing spaces**: Live data shows "Blocked" with trailing whitespace for some status names (e.g., Name column for ID=2). Apply RTRIM() in comparisons if matching by name string.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_Regulation defines the 15 regulatory jurisdictions under which eToro operates globally. Each regulation represents a financial authority (CySEC, FCA, ASIC, FinCEN, etc.) and maps to an eToro legal entity holding the corresponding license. This classification drives multi-jurisdiction compliance - it determines which rules apply to each customer, what instruments they can trade, what leverage limits are enforced, and how their funds are segregated. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, Dictionary.Regulation)

RegulationID is one of the most frequently joined columns in the DWH. It is assigned to users at registration (CustomerStatic.RegulationID) and propagated through every subsequent operation - deposits, trading, copy-trading, and compliance reporting. V_Dim_Customer joins Dim_Regulation to resolve the regulation name for every customer.

**DWH vs Production differences**: The DWH strips 6 columns from production (IsUSA, JurisdictionName, BankID, RegulationLongName, RegulationShortName, DefaultRegulationID) and adds 3 DWH-specific columns (DWHRegulationID = ID alias, StatusID = hardcoded 1, ClusterRegulationID = grouping logic). Analysts needing US/non-US split or jurisdiction names should reference the upstream wiki or query production via the Bronze layer.

Loaded daily by SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse via TRUNCATE+INSERT from DWH_staging.etoro_Dictionary_Regulation. All 15 rows have StatusID=1 (Active). No sentinel row.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 ClusterRegulationID Grouping

**What**: The ETL groups certain regulations into a single cluster (ID=1) for analytics aggregation.

**Columns Involved**: `ClusterRegulationID`, `ID`

**Rules**:
- IDs 0 (None), 1 (CySEC), 5 (BVI) -> ClusterRegulationID=1 (grouped as "CySEC/BVI/None" cluster)
- All other IDs -> ClusterRegulationID = ID (each regulation is its own cluster)

**Rationale**: BVI (5) is the non-US fallback regulation for users in jurisdictions without a specific eToro entity. CySEC (1) is the primary EU regulation. None (0) is the sentinel for unassigned users. Grouping them under cluster 1 allows DWH analytics to treat these three as a single reporting unit.

```
ClusterRegulationID mapping:
  ID=0 (None)    -> Cluster 1
  ID=1 (CySEC)   -> Cluster 1
  ID=5 (BVI)     -> Cluster 1
  All others     -> Cluster = ID (FCA=2, NFA=3, ASIC=4, eToroUS=6, ...)
```

### 2.2 DWH Column Gaps vs Production

**What**: The DWH drops 6 production columns that are needed for full compliance analysis.

**Columns Dropped**:
- `IsUSA` - US/non-US jurisdiction flag (critical for instrument availability branching)
- `JurisdictionName` - eToro legal entity name (e.g., "eToro EU", "eToro UK")
- `BankID` - FK to Dictionary.Bank (custodian banking partner)
- `RegulationLongName` - Full formal name (e.g., "Cyprus Securities Exchange Commission")
- `RegulationShortName` - Abbreviated code for compact display
- `DefaultRegulationID` - Self-reference fallback (non-US->BVI, US->eToroUS)

**Impact**: DWH analytics that need US vs non-US split must either hardcode the IDs (6, 7, 8, 12, 14 are US) or join to the Bronze layer. See Section 3.4 Gotchas.

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with CLUSTERED INDEX on ID. With 15 rows, REPLICATE is optimal. Join on ID directly.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, the Gold export at `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_regulation` is Parquet. Read the entire table for any lookup.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resolve RegulationID to name in customer data | `LEFT JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_Regulation r ON r.ID = cs.RegulationID` |
| Group analytics by regulation cluster | `GROUP BY r.ClusterRegulationID` |
| US vs non-US split (without IsUSA) | `WHERE r.ID IN (6, 7, 8, 12, 14)` for US; else non-US |
| Full customer record with regulation | Use `DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer` (pre-joins Dim_Regulation) |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.CustomerStatic / V_Dim_Customer | ON r.ID = cs.RegulationID | Resolve regulation name per customer |
| DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer | Dim_Regulation already joined (INNER JOIN on RegulationID) | Use view instead of re-joining |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **IsUSA not in DWH**: Production Dictionary.Regulation.IsUSA (US=1, non-US=0) is dropped by ETL. DWH analysts must hardcode: US regulations = IDs 6, 7, 8, 12, 14.
- **DWHRegulationID = ID**: These two columns always have the same value. DWHRegulationID is an ETL alias and appears redundant. Prefer ID for joins.
- **StatusID always 1**: Hardcoded Active for all rows. Not a meaningful filter.
- **Cluster 1 includes 3 regulations**: ClusterRegulationID=1 covers None (0), CySEC (1), and BVI (5). Aggregating by ClusterRegulationID will merge these three.
- **V_Dim_Customer uses INNER JOIN**: V_Dim_Customer has `INNER JOIN Dim_Regulation ON ID = RegulationID`. Customers with NULL RegulationID would be excluded.
- **Production has 6 more columns**: If you need IsUSA, JurisdictionName, or DefaultRegulationID, use the Bronze/staging layer or etoro.Dictionary.Regulation directly.

## 1. Business Meaning

`Dim_Country` is one of the most heavily-referenced dimension tables in the DWH. It defines every country and territory the eToro platform recognizes (251 rows: 250 active countries + 1 "Not available" placeholder at CountryID=0). Each row provides geographic classification, regulatory risk attributes, marketing segmentation, and compliance data for users registered from that country.

When a customer registers, their CountryID determines: which regulatory entity governs them (via RegulationID), what AML/KYC scrutiny level applies (IsHighRiskCountry, RiskGroupID), what marketing desk handles them (Desk), and whether they can receive RAF bonuses (IsEligibleForRAFBonusCountry).

The ETL is multi-step: TRUNCATE+INSERT from etoro.Dictionary.Country (primary, joined to etoro.Dictionary.MarketingRegion for the Region label), then three UPDATE passes that patch in EU classification from Ext_Dim_Country, Desk/CFKey from Ext_Dim_Country_Region_Desk, and RegulationID from ComplianceStateDB.Compliance.RegulationCountry. Several columns present in the upstream Dictionary.Country source are dropped in DWH (IsSettlementRestricted, DefaultCurrencyID, LanguageID, IsActive, PhonePrefix, IsoCode).

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 High-Risk Country Flag (Computed)

**What**: IsHighRiskCountry is derived from RiskGroupID in the ETL, not passed through from source. AML-flagged countries trigger enhanced due diligence.

**Columns Involved**: `IsHighRiskCountry`, `RiskGroupID`

**Rules**:
- `CASE WHEN RiskGroupID IN (0, 4) THEN 0 ELSE 1 END` -> IsHighRiskCountry
- RiskGroupID=0 (None): 70 countries -> not high risk
- RiskGroupID=4 (Verified before deposit): 2 countries -> not high risk
- RiskGroupID=1 (High risk country): 100 countries -> high risk
- RiskGroupID=2 (High risk for new clients): 71 countries -> high risk
- RiskGroupID=3 (High risk FATF country): 8 countries -> high risk
- High-risk countries trigger enhanced document verification, manual review of first deposit, and reduced transaction monitoring thresholds

**Diagram**:
```
RiskGroupID -> IsHighRiskCountry
0 (None)                  -> 0  (70 countries)
4 (Verified bfr deposit)  -> 0  (2 countries)
1 (High risk)             -> 1  (100 countries)
2 (High risk new clients) -> 1  (71 countries)
3 (High risk FATF)        -> 1  (8 countries)
```

### 2.2 EU vs. European Country Classification

**What**: Two separate flags distinguish full EU membership from broader European geography.

**Columns Involved**: `EU`, `IsEuropeanCountry`

**Rules**:
- EU=1: 27 countries with full EU membership (legal/treaty member states)
- IsEuropeanCountry=1: 66 countries total (27 EU members + 39 other European countries)
- Source: Ext_Dim_Country (manual extension table), not from etoro.Dictionary.Country
- EU=1 always implies IsEuropeanCountry=1. IsEuropeanCountry=1 does NOT imply EU=1.

### 2.3 Region vs. MarketingRegion

**What**: DWH exposes two separate geographic segmentations. `Region` is marketing-driven; the source geographic `RegionID` is dropped.

**Columns Involved**: `Region`, `MarketingRegionID`, `MarketingRegionManualName`, `Desk`

**Rules**:
- `Region` is loaded from etoro.Dictionary.MarketingRegion.Name (y.Name AS Region in SP). It is the marketing region label.
- `MarketingRegionManualName` is a manual override from Ext_Dim_Country - may differ from Region (e.g., Albania: Region=ROE, MarketingRegionManualName=CEE).
- `Desk` is a sales/support desk assignment from Ext_Dim_Country_Region_Desk, joined via MarketingRegionID.
- The upstream Dictionary.Country source has a geographic `RegionID` pointing to Dictionary.Region - this is NOT loaded to DWH.
- 22 distinct Region values in DWH (South & Central America=40, Africa=38, ROW=38, French=23, etc.)

### 2.4 Dropped Source Columns (Compliance-Critical)

**What**: Several compliance and localization columns present in the upstream source are NOT loaded to DWH.

**Dropped from etoro.Dictionary.Country**:
- `IsSettlementRestricted`: 21 countries restricted to CFD-only trading (cannot hold REAL assets). Includes United States (SEC/FINRA). CRITICAL for compliance analysts.
- `DefaultCurrencyID`: Trading account default currency (USD/EUR/GBP/AUD/CAD/PLN).
- `LanguageID`: UI language default.
- `IsActive`: Whether country is active on platform.
- `PhonePrefix`: International dialing code.
- `IsoCode`: ISO 3166-1 numeric code.
- `RegionID`: Geographic region FK (DWH replaces with text Region label from MarketingRegion).

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE (correct for a 251-row dimension - broadcast to all nodes avoids data movement on JOINs). HEAP means no sorted index. The non-clustered PK on CountryID is NOT ENFORCED - duplicates are theoretically possible but prevented by ETL TRUNCATE.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, store as Delta (MANAGED), no partitioning needed (251 rows). Z-ORDER on CountryID optional for join optimization.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Decode country for a customer | `JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_Country d ON f.CountryID = d.CountryID` |
| Filter high-risk countries | `WHERE d.IsHighRiskCountry = 1` |
| Filter EU customers | `WHERE d.EU = 1` |
| Group by marketing region | `GROUP BY d.Region` |
| Find regulation for a country | `SELECT RegulationID FROM Dim_Country WHERE CountryID = @id` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON c.CountryID = d.CountryID | Decode customer country attributes |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_BillingDeposit | ON f.CountryID = d.CountryID | Country-level deposit analytics |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_CountryBin | ON c.CountryID = d.CountryID | BIN-to-country card mapping |
| DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer | ON v.CountryID = d.CountryID | Customer view with country decode |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- CountryID=0 ("Not available") is a real row - use `WHERE CountryID > 0` to exclude the placeholder in population-level queries.
- `IsHighRiskCountry` is RECOMPUTED from `RiskGroupID` by the ETL (not passthrough from source). If source IsHighRiskCountry changes but RiskGroupID stays the same, DWH will not reflect the change.
- `IsSettlementRestricted` is NOT in DWH. This critical compliance flag must be looked up in the source etoro.Dictionary.Country if needed.
- `Region` reflects `MarketingRegion.Name`, not the geographic `Dictionary.Region`. The two segmentations differ (e.g., Albania: geographic region=Europe, marketing Region=ROE).
- `DWHCountryID` always equals `CountryID` (redundant copy from SP: `x.CountryID AS DWHCountryID`). Never use both in GROUP BY.
- `StatusID` is hardcoded to 1 for all rows (including CountryID=0). No meaningful variation.
- `InsertDate` and `UpdateDate` are both set to GETDATE() on each daily reload - they reflect ETL run time, not original insert or data change time.

## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Dim_MifidCategorization` maps the MiFID II customer classification IDs used throughout the eToro platform to human-readable tier names. MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II) is the EU regulatory framework governing retail and professional financial clients. Customer classification determines leverage caps, margin requirements, negative balance protection eligibility, and disclosure obligations.

The 6 rows define the complete classification space:

| ID | Name | Meaning |
|----|------|---------|
| 0 | None | Not classified / not applicable (e.g., US customers not subject to MiFID) |
| 1 | Retail | Standard retail client -- maximum investor protection, lowest leverage limits |
| 2 | Professional | Institutional or experienced investor -- lower protection, higher leverage allowed |
| 3 | Elective professional | Retail client who has applied for professional status (opted-up) |
| 4 | Retail Pending | Retail classification in progress (e.g., registration not yet complete) |
| 5 | Pending | General pending state (categorization in progress) |

ETL: part of `SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse` (TRUNCATE + INSERT from `DWH_staging.etoro_Dictionary_MifidCategorization`).

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 MiFID II Classification Tiers

**What**: Customer accounts are classified into one of these tiers based on their trading experience, financial knowledge, and portfolio size.

**Rules**:
- **Retail (1)**: The default classification. ESMA leverage caps apply (e.g., 30:1 for major forex). Full investor protection: negative balance protection, margin close-out rules.
- **Professional (2)**: Reserved for institutional clients and high-net-worth individuals meeting regulatory criteria. Higher leverage allowed; reduced investor protections.
- **Elective Professional (3)**: A retail client who has voluntarily opted up to professional status after meeting specific criteria (trading frequency, portfolio size, experience). eToro-specific status that lies between 1 and 2.
- **None (0)**: Not subject to MiFID II (e.g., US-regulated accounts under CFTC/NFA rules, or unclassified system accounts).
- **Retail Pending (4) / Pending (5)**: Transitional states during onboarding or reclassification.

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Get customer MiFID tier by name | `JOIN Dim_MifidCategorization ON MifidCategorizationID; SELECT Name` |
| Find all retail customers | `WHERE MifidCategorizationID = 1` |
| Find professional/elective-professional | `WHERE MifidCategorizationID IN (2, 3)` |
| Exclude unclassified/pending | `WHERE MifidCategorizationID IN (1, 2, 3)` |

### 3.2 Gotchas

- **MifidCategorizationID=0 is NOT a null-sentinel for EU customers**: For EU customers, 0 means "not classified" which may be a data quality issue. NULL is different from 0.
- **UpdateDate is GETDATE() at load**: Does not reflect when the classification definitions last changed in production.

# BI_DB_First5Actions

> Customer onboarding behavior profile. One row per depositor. Records the first five trading actions each customer took, the asset classes they touched, key revenue/deposit/equity milestones at 1/7/14/30/60/90/180/360-day windows post-FTD, and demographics from registration. The primary analytical use case is understanding "what did this customer do first after depositing?" — a critical input for activation and retention analysis. Used directly by SP_DepositUsersFirstTouchPoints.

## Business Context

`BI_DB_First5Actions` answers the question: *"What did this customer do first after depositing, and how did they perform in subsequent weeks/months?"*

The table is scoped to **depositors only** — the SP filters `BI_DB_CIDFirstDates WHERE FirstDepositDate IS NOT NULL`. Customers who registered but never deposited are excluded.

The 88.3% NULL `FirstAction` rate reflects that most depositors never open a trading position — they deposit money but do not actively trade within the system's tracking window for the first 5 position-opening actions.

The **cross columns** (`FirstCross`, `FirstCrossNew`, etc.) represent "asset class crossings" — each time a customer trades in a *different* asset class from their previous trade. The legacy series (`FirstCross..FifthCross`) uses the older `BI_DB_CustomerCross` source; the new series (`FirstCrossNew..FifthCrossNew`) uses `BI_DB_CustomerCross_New` with the updated `ActionTypeNew` taxonomy.

**Action type taxonomies**:
| Column Group | Values |
|---|---|
| FirstAction..FifthAction (coarse) | Crypto, FX/Commodities/Indices, Stocks/ETFs, Copy, Copy Fund |
| FirstActionTypeNew (mid-level) | Crypto, FX/Commodities, Stocks/ETFs/Indices, Copy, Copy Fund |
| FirstAction_Detailed (granular) | Crypto, FX/Commodities/Indices, Real Stocks/ETFs, CFD Stocks/ETFs, Copy, Copy Fund |
| FirstCross..FifthCross (legacy) | Same as ActionType_Detailed |
| FirstCrossNew..FifthCrossNew (new) | Same as ActionTypeNew |

**Real vs CFD Stocks distinction** (FirstAction_Detailed only):
- Real Stocks/ETFs = `InstrumentTypeID IN (5,6) AND Leverage=1 AND IsBuy=1`
- CFD Stocks/ETFs = `InstrumentTypeID IN (5,6) AND (Leverage>1 OR IsBuy=0)`
