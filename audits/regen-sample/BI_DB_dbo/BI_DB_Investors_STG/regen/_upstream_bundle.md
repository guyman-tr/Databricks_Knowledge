## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_Position is the central trading record table in DWH, containing every position (trade) ever opened on the eToro platform. Each row represents a single trading position lifecycle: opened by a customer (CID) on an instrument (InstrumentID), held for some duration, and either still open (CloseDateID=0) or closed with a final NetProfit. The data spans positions from 2007-08-27 to the most recent load date (2026-03-10 as of last ETL run 2026-03-11).

**Position types represented**:
- **Retail positions**: Opened by customers directly in the eToro web/mobile app
- **Mirror/CopyTrading positions**: Opened when a customer copies another trader (MirrorID links to Dim_Mirror); ParentPositionID links to the "master" position
- **Copy Fund positions**: IsCopyFundPosition=1 when the position's root (TreeID) belongs to a fund account (AccountTypeID=9)
- **AirDrop positions**: IsAirDrop=1 for positions created via airdrop events (crypto)
- **ReOpen positions**: IsReOpen=1 for positions reopened after a ReOpen event; ReopenForPositionID points to the original

**Open vs Closed state**:
- Open position: CloseDateID=0, CloseOccurred='1900-01-01 00:00:00'
- Closed position: CloseDateID=YYYYMMDD (e.g., 20260310), CloseOccurred = actual close timestamp

**Data Sources (merged in ETL)**:
- Open positions: `etoro_Trade_OpenPositionEndOfDay` (today's snapshot of all open positions)
- Closed positions: `etoro_History_ClosePositionEndOfDay` (positions that closed on @dt)

**134 columns** covering financial amounts, forex rates at open/close, market prices (spread data), execution IDs, order IDs, hedge types, and fee calculations added through 2025.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Open vs Closed Position States

**What**: The same position row transitions from "open" to "closed" as its lifecycle progresses.

**Columns Involved**: `CloseDateID`, `CloseOccurred`, `NetProfit`, `EndForexRate`, `ClosePositionReasonID`

**Rules**:
- **Open state**: CloseDateID=0, CloseOccurred='1900-01-01 00:00:00.000'. NetProfit holds unrealized P&L (updated daily). EndForexRate=NULL (position not yet closed).
- **Closed state**: CloseDateID=YYYYMMDD int (e.g., 20260310), CloseOccurred=actual datetime. NetProfit holds realized P&L. ClosePositionReasonID explains why it closed.
- **ETL daily cycle**: Each day, rows for positions that opened or closed that day are deleted/updated and re-inserted fresh from staging.
- **CloseDateID=19000101** is a transient internal state used during ETL processing (positions being "reset" before re-insertion); analysts should filter `WHERE CloseDateID NOT IN (0, 19000101)` for confirmed closed positions.
- **OpenDateID and CloseDateID**: Both are YYYYMMDD integers, NOT dates. Use `CAST(CAST(OpenDateID AS VARCHAR(8)) AS DATE)` to convert.

**Diagram**:
```
Position lifecycle in Dim_Position:
  Day 1 (open):  CloseDateID=0,        CloseOccurred='1900-01-01'  <-- still open
  Day N (close): CloseDateID=YYYYMMDD, CloseOccurred=actual time   <-- closed
  During ETL:    CloseDateID=19000101  <-- transient, skip in queries
```

### 2.2 Social Trading Relationships

**What**: How copy-trading and mirror relationships are encoded.

**Columns Involved**: `MirrorID`, `ParentPositionID`, `OrigParentPositionID`, `TreeID`, `IsCopyFundPosition`

**Rules**:
- **MirrorID**: FK to Dim_Mirror. When a customer copies another trader, all positions generated share the same MirrorID.
- **ParentPositionID**: The position ID of the "master" position being copied. NULL for original/manual positions.
- **OrigParentPositionID**: The original parent (before any reopen/rebalance operations).
- **TreeID**: FK back to Dim_Position.PositionID -- points to the root position of the copy tree. Used to identify CopyFund positions.
- **IsCopyFundPosition=1**: The position belongs to a copy-fund tree (TreeID's CID has AccountTypeID=9).

### 2.3 Financial Metrics and Commissions

**What**: How P&L and commission amounts flow through a position lifecycle.

**Columns Involved**: `Amount`, `NetProfit`, `Commission`, `CommissionOnClose`, `FullCommission`, `FullCommissionOnClose`, `EndOfWeekFee`, `PnLInDollars`

**Rules**:
- **Amount**: Position notional value in USD at open.
- **NetProfit**: Realized P&L for closed positions; unrealized daily P&L for open positions (updated daily from EndOfDayPnLInDollars).
- **Commission**: Opening commission charged.
- **CommissionOnClose**: Closing commission. Set to 0 for open positions; filled when position closes.
- **FullCommission / FullCommissionOnClose**: Total commissions including all components.
- **EndOfWeekFee**: Overnight fee charged on weekends for leveraged positions. CloseOnEndOfWeek=1 means position auto-closes at weekend.
- **PnLInDollars**: Unrealized daily P&L for open positions (from EndOfDayPnLInDollars staging column); realized at close.

### 2.4 Position Segmentation and Regulation

**What**: Regulatory context and platform categorization at time of open.

**Columns Involved**: `RegulationIDOnOpen`, `PlatformTypeID`, `PositionSegment`

**Rules**:
- **RegulationIDOnOpen**: The regulatory jurisdiction (entity) the customer belonged to at the time of opening. Derived from a JOIN with etoro_History_BackOfficeCustomer at ETL time. 1=UK/FCA, 2=Cyprus/CySEC, etc.
- **PlatformTypeID**: FK to Dim_PlatformType. 1=Web, 2=iOS, 3=Android, 0=Undefined.
- **PositionSegment**: Internal segment classification (smallint).

### 2.5 Volume and Unit Calculations

**What**: ETL-computed unit and volume metrics.

**Columns Involved**: `AmountInUnitsDecimal`, `LotCountDecimal`, `Volume`, `VolumeOnClose`, `UnitMargin`, `InitialUnits`

**Rules**:
- **AmountInUnitsDecimal**: Position size in instrument units (e.g., shares, crypto coins).
- **LotCountDecimal**: Position size in lots.
- **Volume**: ETL-computed = ROUND(AmountInUnitsDecimal * InitForexRate * USD conversion factor, 0) -- approximates USD equivalent at open.
- **VolumeOnClose**: Similar calculation using EndForexRate at close.
- **UnitMargin**: Margin per unit for leveraged positions.
- **InitialUnits**: Original units before any partial-close or partial-reopen adjustments.

### 2.6 Open/Close Rates and Market Prices

**What**: The forex rates, market prices, and spread data captured at open and close.

**Columns Involved**: `InitForexRate`, `EndForexRate`, `SpreadedPipBid`, `SpreadedPipAsk`, `InitForex_Ask/Bid/AskSpreaded/BidSpreaded/USDConversionRate`, `EndForex_*`, `OpenMarket_*`, `CloseMarket_*`

**Rules**:
- **InitForexRate / EndForexRate**: The execution rate at open and close respectively (in instrument's base currency per USD or USD per instrument).
- **InitForex_* columns**: Ask, Bid, spreaded variants, and USD conversion rate at the INIT price rate ID (raw price book). Populated from PriceLog_History_CurrencyPrice_Active.
- **EndForex_***: Same price book data at the END (close) rate.
- **OpenMarket_* / CloseMarket_***: Market prices at the time of market open/close events. Added 2023-03-07 (12 columns).
- **SpreadedPipBid / SpreadedPipAsk**: Bid/ask spread in pips at execution.

### 2.7 Fees and Taxes (Post-2025)

**What**: Tax and fee components added in 2025.

**Columns Involved**: `OpenTotalTaxes`, `CloseTotalTaxes`, `OpenTotalFees`, `CloseTotalFees`, `EstimateCloseFeeForCFD`, `EstimateCloseFeeOnOpenByUnits`, `EstimateCloseFeeOnOpen`, `Close_PnLInDollars`, `Close_CalculationRate`, `Close_ConversionRate`, `Close_PriceType`, `CurrentCalculationRate`, `CurrentConversionRate`

**Rules**:
- Added 2025-06-25 (Adi Ferber) and 2025-09-08 (Daniel Kaplan).
- These columns will be NULL for positions opened/closed before the ETL addition date.
- `EstimateCloseFeeForCFD/OnOpenByUnits/OnOpen`: Fee estimates for CFD instruments at open.
- `Close_PnLInDollars / Close_CalculationRate / Close_ConversionRate / Close_PriceType`: Close-side P&L metrics with explicit calculation chain.

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Partitioning

**HASH (PositionID)**: Rows distributed by PositionID across nodes. Single-position lookups are efficient. JOINs between two HASH(PositionID) tables (e.g., Dim_Position JOIN Dim_PositionChangeLog by PositionID) are co-located and fast.

**Clustered Index (CloseDateID, PositionID)**: Clustered on close date -- date-range queries on closed positions are efficient. Open-position queries (CloseDateID=0) hit a single partition.

**Monthly partitioning**: Partitioned from 2007-01-01 to 2026-02-28 by CloseDateID. Always include a CloseDateID range filter in queries to enable partition elimination. Without it, all 230+ partitions are scanned.

**NOT ENFORCED PK**: The primary key on (PositionID, CloseDateID) is NOT ENFORCED. Synapse does not validate uniqueness. PositionID is logically unique per position, but be aware: duplicate PositionIDs can exist if ETL has a bug.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, this table lands as `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_position`. Partitioned monthly by CloseDateID. Use `WHERE CloseDateID >= 20260101` style filters for partition pruning. Z-ORDER on PositionID within each partition is beneficial for position-lookup workloads.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Get closed positions for a date range | WHERE CloseDateID BETWEEN 20260101 AND 20260310 |
| Get all open positions | WHERE CloseDateID = 0 |
| Get a customer's positions | WHERE CID = X AND CloseDateID BETWEEN ... (always include date range!) |
| P&L for closed positions | SUM(NetProfit) WHERE CloseDateID > 0 AND CloseDateID != 19000101 |
| CopyTrading positions only | WHERE MirrorID IS NOT NULL |
| Direct (non-copy) positions | WHERE MirrorID IS NULL AND ParentPositionID IS NULL |
| CopyFund positions only | WHERE IsCopyFundPosition = 1 |
| Long positions only | WHERE IsBuy = 1 |
| Short positions | WHERE IsBuy = 0 |
| By instrument | WHERE InstrumentID = X AND CloseDateID BETWEEN ... |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Instrument | ON InstrumentID | Resolve instrument name, asset class |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON CID | Customer info, tier, country |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Currency | ON CurrencyID | Position base currency |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Mirror | ON MirrorID | Copy-trading relationship details |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_ClosePositionReason | ON ClosePositionReasonID | Why position was closed |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Platform | ON PlatformTypeID | Platform used to open |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Date | ON OpenDateID / CloseDateID | Calendar dimensions |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_PositionChangeLog | ON PositionID | Position lifecycle changes (IsSettled, Amount changes) |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **NEVER query without CloseDateID filter**: Without a date range filter, Synapse scans all 230+ monthly partitions. Always include `WHERE CloseDateID BETWEEN X AND Y` or `WHERE CloseDateID = 0`.
- **CloseDateID=0 for open, CloseDateID=19000101 during ETL**: Exclude 19000101 in most queries: `WHERE CloseDateID NOT IN (0, 19000101)` for confirmed-closed positions.
- **OpenDateID and CloseDateID are int, not date**: They are in YYYYMMDD format. Use `CAST(CAST(OpenDateID AS VARCHAR(8)) AS DATE)` to convert.
- **HASH distribution on PositionID**: Very efficient for single-position or position-list queries. Less efficient for large customer-level scans (CID is not the distribution key).
- **NOT ENFORCED PK**: PositionID uniqueness is not enforced by the database. Check for duplicates if needed.
- **134 columns -- many nullable**: Most columns beyond the core set are NULL for older positions predating their addition (2022-2025). Don't assume non-null.
- **Volume = ETL-computed approximation**: Volume (int) is rounded to nearest integer. VolumeOnClose uses EndForexRate which may differ. Not always perfectly accurate.
- **UpdateDate = GETDATE() or GETUTCDATE()**: Mixed -- open positions use GETDATE(), UPDATE path for closing positions uses GETUTCDATE(). Not a reliable "modified since" field.
- **IsPartialCloseParent / IsPartialCloseChild**: 1 if this position was split via partial close. Use OriginalPositionID to trace the original. Generally filter ISNULL(IsPartialCloseChild,0)=0 on OPEN metrics only — NEVER on CLOSE. Some open metrics (e.g., volume) are already pro-rated, so excluding children would be wrong. Apply the filter case-by-case.
- **RegulationIDOnOpen is 0 for unmatched**: If the ETL JOIN with BackOfficeCustomer history finds no regulation at that date, ISNULL defaults to 0.
- **AmountInUnitsDecimal may change**: Position amount can be adjusted (e.g., partial close). Dim_PositionChangeLog tracks historical amount values.

## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Fact_CustomerAction` is the unified customer event log for the eToro platform. Every significant action a customer performs — opening a position, closing a position, depositing money, withdrawing, logging in, publishing a social post, receiving a fee, getting a bonus, registering an account — is captured as a single row in this table. It answers: "What did this customer do, when, and what were the financial details?"

The table consolidates events from five distinct production sources into a single ActionTypeID-driven schema:
1. **Position opens** (ActionTypeID 1-3, 39): From `Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay` via the Generic Pipeline + staging
2. **Position closes** (ActionTypeID 4-6, 28, 40): From `History.ClosePositionEndOfDay` via the Generic Pipeline + staging
3. **Credit/financial events** (ActionTypeID 7-13, 15-20, 27, 30, 32, 34-38, 42-45): From `History.Credit` (which unions `History.ActiveCredit` + archived Credit partition tables back to 2007)
4. **Logins** (ActionTypeID 14): From `STS_Audit_UserOperationsData` (Session Tracking Service) with platform/browser detection
5. **Registrations** (ActionTypeID 41): From `Customer.CustomerStatic`

Because the table unions fundamentally different event types, **most columns are only populated for specific ActionTypeIDs**. Position-related columns (InstrumentID, Leverage, Commission, IsBuy, etc.) are NULL/0 for non-position events. Fee-specific columns (IsFeeDividend, DividendID) are only set for ActionTypeID=35. This is a sparse fact table by design.

The data originates from production systems, flows through the Azure Data Lake and DWH staging tables, and is loaded by `SP_Fact_CustomerAction_DL_To_Synapse` (staging extract) and `SP_Fact_CustomerAction` (transform + load). Post-load, `SP_Fact_CustomerAction_IsParitalCloseParent` marks partial-close parents. The load uses SWITCH partition for daily increments.

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 ActionTypeID — Event Classification

**What**: Every row is classified by ActionTypeID, which determines what type of customer action occurred and which columns are populated.

**Columns Involved**: `ActionTypeID`, mapped via `DWH_dbo.Dim_ActionType`

**Rules**:

| ActionTypeID | Name | Category | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ManualPositionOpen | PositionOpen | Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay — MirrorID=0, OrigParentPositionID=0 |
| 2 | CopyPositionOpen | PositionOpen | Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay — MirrorID>0, OrigParentPositionID>0 |
| 3 | CopyPlusPositionOpen | PositionOpen | Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay — MirrorID=0, OrigParentPositionID>0 |
| 4 | ManualPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 5 | CopyPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 6 | CopyPlusPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 7 | Deposit | Deposit | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=1) |
| 8 | Cashout | Cashout | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=2) |
| 9 | Bonus | Bonus | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=7) |
| 10 | Cashout request | Cashout request | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=9) |
| 11 | Chargeback | Chargeback | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=11) |
| 12 | Refund | Refund | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=12) |
| 14 | LoggedIn | LoggedIn | STS_Audit_UserOperationsData |
| 15 | Account balance to mirror | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=18) |
| 16 | Mirror balance to account | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=19) |
| 17 | Register new mirror | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=20) |
| 18 | Unregister mirror | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=21) |
| 19 | Detach position from mirror | DetachPosition | History.Credit |
| 21-26 | Publish Post/Comment/Like, Received Post/Comment/Like | Social engagement | **DEAD DATA** — legacy rows exist but no longer updated. No active ETL. |
| 27 | DepositAttempt | DepositAttempt | History.Credit |
| 28 | DetachedPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 29 | Cashier Loggin | Cashier login | Billing.Login |
| 30 | Processed Cashout | Processed Cashout | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=2 processed) |
| 32 | Edit StopLoss | Edit StopLoss | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=13) |
| 34 | Open Stock Order | Stock order | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=29) |
| 35 | End Of The Week Fee | Fees | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=14) — overnight, weekend, dividend, SDRT, ticket fees |
| 36 | Compensation | Compensation | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=6) |
| 37 | Reverse cashout | Reverse cashout | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=8) |
| 38 | Affiliate Deposit | Deposit | History.Credit |
| 39 | PositionOpenTypeUnknown | PositionOpen | Position open without matching History.Credit (fix at weekly maintenance) |
| 40 | PositionCloseTypeUnknown | PositionClose | Position close without matching History.Credit |
| 41 | Customer Registration | Registration | Customer.CustomerStatic |
| 42 | Cashout Rollback | Chargeback | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=33) |
| 43 | Reverse Deposit | Reverse Deposit | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=32) |
| 44 | InternalDeposit | Deposit | History.Credit (MoveMoneyReasonID=5) |
| 45 | InternalWithdraw | Withdraw | History.Credit (MoveMoneyReasonID=5) |

### 2.2 IsFeeDividend — Fee Sub-Classification

**What**: For ActionTypeID=35 (End of Week Fee), classifies the specific fee type.

**Columns Involved**: `IsFeeDividend`, `Description`

**Rules** (per DSM-1463):
- `1` = Overnight/weekend fee (Description: "Over night fee", "Weekend fee")
- `2` = Dividend payment (Description LIKE '%dividend%')
- `3` = SDRT charge (Description LIKE '%sdrt%')
- `4` = Ticket fees (Description: "OpenTotalFees" or "CloseTotalFees")
- `NULL` = Not ActionTypeID=35

### 2.3 Position-Derived Columns (Shared with Dim_Position)

**What**: ~33 columns in Fact_CustomerAction are copies of the same data from `Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay` / `History.ClosePositionEndOfDay` that also populates `DWH_dbo.Dim_Position`. These columns display the same data under the same column names but are populated independently at ETL time.

**Shared columns**: `PositionID`, `InstrumentID`, `Amount`, `Leverage`, `Commission`, `CommissionOnClose`, `FullCommission`, `FullCommissionOnClose`, `MirrorID`, `IsSettled`, `InitialUnits`, `IsDiscounted`, `CommissionByUnits`, `FullCommissionByUnits`, `RegulationIDOnOpen`, `ReopenForPositionID`, `IsReOpen`, `CommissionOnCloseOrig`, `FullCommissionOnCloseOrig`, `OriginalPositionID`, `IsPartialCloseParent`, `IsPartialCloseChild`, `IsAirDrop`, `SettlementTypeID`, `DLTOpen`, `DLTClose`, `OpenMarkupByUnits`, `IsBuy`, `NetProfit`, `RedeemStatus`, `RedeemID`, `IsRedeem`

**Rules**:
- These columns are ONLY populated for position events (ActionTypeID IN 1-6, 28, 39, 40)
- For non-position events, these columns are 0 or NULL
- The ETL joins from staging tables directly — NOT from Dim_Position itself
- Column meanings are identical to Dim_Position (see `Dim_Position.md` for detailed descriptions)

### 2.4 PlatformID — Product/Platform Resolution

**What**: Identifies which product/platform the action originated from. Badly named — it's actually a FK to `Dim_Product.ProductID`, not a standalone platform enum.

**Columns Involved**: `PlatformID`

**Rules**:
- Only populated for ActionTypeID=14 (logins) and 41 (registrations)
- Resolve via JOIN to `DWH_dbo.Dim_Product` — provides Product, Platform, and SubPlatform columns
- Do NOT hard-code value mappings (101=Android, etc.) — always JOIN to Dim_Product

**Query pattern**:
```sql
SELECT dp.Product, dp.Platform, dp.SubPlatform, fca.*
FROM DWH_dbo.Fact_CustomerAction fca
JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_Product dp ON fca.PlatformID = dp.ProductID
WHERE fca.ActionTypeID = 14
```

### 2.6 Reopen Commission Adjustment

**What**: For reopened positions (IsReOpen=1), the commission at close is adjusted.

**Columns Involved**: `CommissionOnClose`, `FullCommissionOnClose`, `CommissionOnCloseOrig`, `FullCommissionOnCloseOrig`, `IsReOpen`, `ReopenForPositionID`

**Rules**:
- `CommissionOnClose = new_position.CommissionOnClose - original_position.CommissionOnClose`
- `CommissionOnCloseOrig` / `FullCommissionOnCloseOrig` preserve original values

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is HASH-distributed on `RealCID` with a CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX + 4 nonclustered indexes (`ActionTypeID+DateID`, `ActionTypeID`, `CompensationReasonID`, `RealCID+DateID`). Always include `RealCID` in WHERE or JOIN for optimal single-distribution queries. The columnstore index enables efficient analytical scans across the ~11B rows.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, this table is stored as **Delta** (EXTERNAL, ~430 GB, ~7K files), partitioned by `etr_y`, `etr_ym`, `etr_ymd` (year, year-month, year-month-day). Always include partition columns in WHERE clauses for partition pruning — e.g., `WHERE etr_y = '2025' AND etr_ym = '202503'` will skip scanning irrelevant partitions. Given the table's ~11B rows, partition pruning is critical for any practical query. The partition columns are Databricks-layer additions not present in the Synapse source. Deletion vectors are enabled (`delta.enableDeletionVectors = true`).

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| All logins for a customer | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 14 AND RealCID = @cid` |
| Position opens in a date range | `WHERE ActionTypeID IN (1,2,3) AND DateID BETWEEN @start AND @end` |
| Revenue (commissions) | `WHERE ActionTypeID IN (1,2,3,4,5,6,28) AND Commission > 0` |
| Deposits for a customer | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 7 AND RealCID = @cid` |
| Overnight fees | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 35 AND IsFeeDividend = 1` |
| Dividend payments | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 35 AND IsFeeDividend = 2` |
| First-time deposits (FTD) | `WHERE IsFTD = 1` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_ActionType` | `ON fca.ActionTypeID = dat.ActionTypeID` | Action type name and category |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer` | `ON fca.RealCID = dc.RealCID` | Customer demographics, country |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Instrument` | `ON fca.InstrumentID = di.InstrumentID` | Instrument name (position events only) |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Position` | `ON fca.PositionID = dp.PositionID` | Full position details (avoid when possible — heavy join on 11B rows) |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_BonusType` | `ON fca.BonusTypeID = dbt.BonusTypeID` | Bonus type name, IsWithdrawable (bonus events only) |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Campaign` | `ON fca.CampaignID = dcm.CampaignID` | Campaign code, description, dates |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Country` | `ON fca.CountryIDByIP = dco.CountryID` | Country name from IP geolocation |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_FundingType` | `ON fca.FundingTypeID = dft.FundingTypeID` | Payment method name (deposit/cashout events) |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_PaymentStatus` | `ON fca.PaymentStatusID = dps.PaymentStatusID` | Payment status name |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Product` | `ON fca.PlatformID = dp.ProductID` | Product, Platform, SubPlatform (logins/registrations only) |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Date` | `ON fca.DateID = dd.DateID` | Calendar attributes |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Regulation` | `ON fca.RegulationIDOnOpen = dr.ID` | Regulation name |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **Most columns are only populated for specific ActionTypeIDs.** InstrumentID, Leverage, Commission, IsBuy are all 0/NULL for logins, deposits, social events, etc.
- **11 billion rows** — always filter by ActionTypeID + DateID to avoid full scans
- **IsReal is always 1** in this table — it only contains real-account actions (no demo)
- **Leverage=0 means non-position event**, not "no leverage". For actual position opens, Leverage=1 means no leverage (real ownership)
- **IsBuy NULL** means non-position event. For position events: True=Buy, False=Sell
- **Description is sparse** — only populated for fee events (ActionTypeID=35) and a few others. Contains human-readable strings like "Over night fee", "Payment caused by dividend", "OpenTotalFees"
- **PlatformTypeID** vs **PlatformID**: PlatformTypeID is a legacy field (0=default, 99=STS); PlatformID is a FK to `Dim_Product.ProductID` (badly named — always JOIN to Dim_Product, don't hard-code values)
- **StatusID is nearly always 1** (~11B rows with StatusID=1, ~2M NULL)
- **DemoCID is always 0** (real accounts only)
- **HistoryID is NOT unique** — despite being intended as a key, it contains duplicates. Never use it for JOINs, deduplication, or row identification

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_Instrument is the master instrument dimension for the DWH, containing 15,707 rows representing every tradeable instrument on the eToro platform. It covers Stocks (12,849), ETFs (1,287), Crypto Currencies (667), Commodities (503), Indices (247), and Currencies/Forex (153), plus one sentinel row (InstrumentID=0, 'NA').

The table is populated by `DWH_dbo.SP_Dim_Instrument`, which performs a full truncate-and-reload on each run. The SP joins the staging replica of the production `Trade.GetInstrument` view with `Dictionary.Currency` (for buy/sell abbreviations), `Trade.InstrumentMetaData` (display names, symbols, exchange, ISIN, industry), `Trade.ProviderToInstrument` (precision, allow flags, bonus credit, provider margin), `Trade.InstrumentCusip` (CUSIP identifiers), `Trade.FuturesMetaData` (multiplier, settlement time), `Trade.FuturesInstrumentsInitialMarginByProviderMapping` (provider margin per lot), and `Trade.Instrument` (OperationMode).

After the initial INSERT, the SP performs post-insert UPDATEs to enrich rows with: ReceivedOnPriceServer (from PriceLog history), AssetClass/IndustryGroup (from a static classification table), ADV_Last3Months/MKTcap/SharesOutStanding (from Rankings.StockInfo.InstrumentData), and PlatformSector/PlatformIndustry (from Rankings platform metadata). Finally, a sentinel row (InstrumentID=0) is inserted with 'NA' placeholder values, and `SP_Dim_Instrument_Snapshot` is called for date-partitioned snapshots.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 InstrumentType CASE Mapping

**What**: Translates numeric InstrumentTypeID into human-readable asset class labels.

**Columns Involved**: `InstrumentTypeID`, `InstrumentType`

**Rules**:
- 1 = Currencies (153 instruments)
- 2 = Commodities (503)
- 4 = Indices (247)
- 5 = Stocks (12,849)
- 6 = ETF (1,287)
- 10 = Crypto Currencies (667)
- All others = Other

### 2.2 IsMajor Flag Mapping

**What**: Converts the production bit flag IsMajor (0/1) into a Yes/No string.

**Columns Involved**: `IsMajorID`, `IsMajor`

**Rules**:
- IsMajorID stores the raw bit value from Trade.GetInstrument.IsMajor
- IsMajor = 'Yes' when IsMajorID = 1, 'No' otherwise
- Yes: 6,963 instruments; No: 8,743; NA: 1 (sentinel)

### 2.3 IsFuture Derivation from InstrumentGroups

**What**: Determines whether an instrument is a futures contract based on membership in GroupID=25 in Trade.InstrumentGroups.

**Columns Involved**: `IsFuture`

**Rules**:
- 1 if InstrumentID exists in Trade.InstrumentGroups WHERE GroupID=25
- 0 otherwise
- 243 instruments flagged as futures; 15,463 non-futures

### 2.4 Post-Insert Market Data Enrichment

**What**: After the main INSERT, the SP updates financial metrics from Rankings.StockInfo data.

**Columns Involved**: `ADV_Last3Months`, `MKTcap`, `SharesOutStanding`, `PlatformSector`, `PlatformIndustry`

**Rules**:
- ADV_Last3Months from MetadataID=8557 (KeyName='AverageDailyVolumeLast3Months-TTM')
- MKTcap = ISNULL(MarketCapitalization-TTM, CryptoMarketCap) — falls back to crypto market cap
- SharesOutStanding from MetadataID=8444 (KeyName='SharesOutstandingCurrent-Annual')
- PlatformSector from MetadataID=8436 (StrVal, pivoted)
- PlatformIndustry from MetadataID=8280 (StrVal, pivoted)

### 2.5 Sentinel Row

**What**: A placeholder row with InstrumentID=0 is inserted at the end of the SP for FK safety.

**Columns Involved**: All

**Rules**:
- InstrumentID=0, InstrumentTypeID=0, InstrumentType='NA', Name='NA'
- Most nullable columns set to NULL
- StatusID=NULL (vs 1 for data rows)

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

REPLICATE distribution means the full table is copied to every compute node — ideal for a 15K-row dimension used in JOINs with large fact tables. CLUSTERED INDEX on InstrumentID supports point lookups and range scans. No distribution key to worry about for colocation.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Look up an instrument by ID | `WHERE InstrumentID = @id` — clustered index seek |
| Filter by asset class | `WHERE InstrumentType = 'Stocks'` or `WHERE InstrumentTypeID = 5` |
| Find tradeable instruments | `WHERE Tradable = 1` |
| Futures only | `WHERE IsFuture = 1` |
| Search by symbol | `WHERE Symbol = 'AAPL'` or `WHERE SymbolFull = 'AAPL'` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Fact tables (positions, orders) | `ON f.InstrumentID = di.InstrumentID` | Resolve instrument name, type, exchange |
| Dim_Customer | Via fact table bridge | Instrument exposure per customer |
| Fact_CurrencyPriceWithSplit | `ON f.InstrumentID = di.InstrumentID` | Price data with instrument metadata |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **InstrumentID=0 is a sentinel** — exclude it with `WHERE InstrumentID > 0` in aggregations
- **IsMajor is a varchar 'Yes'/'No'**, not a bit — use IsMajorID (int) for numeric filters
- **InstrumentType 'NA'** only appears on the sentinel row
- **Multiplier is NULL** for 15,464 of 15,707 rows — only populated for futures instruments
- **AssetClass is NULL** for 13,557 rows — only populated from the static classification table
- **OperationMode is NULL** for sentinel row only; 0=Standard (13,140), 1=Alternate (2,566, primarily European stock CFDs)

## 1. Business Meaning

Fact_SnapshotCustomer is the central customer state table in the DWH. For every eToro customer (RealCID), it holds one row per distinct attribute state within a year, recording which attributes were active between FromDate and ToDate (encoded together in `DateRangeID`). The pattern is SCD Type 2 by year: each year's rows are closed as attribute changes occur, and a new open row is created with the updated state. At year-end, all open rows are closed and reopened with the new year's date range.

As of 2026-03-19: **406M+ total rows**, **46.4M distinct customers**, data from **2007-08-22 to present**. 302M rows are "currently open" (ToDate = year-end). 11.9% of current open rows represent depositors; 98.0% are valid customers (IsValidCustomer=1).

The SP loads data from 6 source systems via staging Ext_FSC tables pre-populated by SP_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_DL_To_Synapse. The core CC (Customer Core) source provides demographics and status; the BO (Back Office) source provides risk/compliance attributes. RegulationID is taken from RegulationChangeLog — **not** from Back Office — because regulation changes take effect end-of-day.

8 legacy columns (DemoCID, CustomerChangeTypeID, CurentValue, PreviousValue, DocsOK, Bankruptcy, PremiumAccount, Evangelist) are present in the DDL but NOT populated by the current SP. They carry DEFAULT (0) values.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 SCD Type 2 Pattern — DateRangeID

**What**: Each customer-state row has a DateRangeID encoding both the open date (FromDate) and close date (ToDate) as a 12-digit bigint.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `RealCID`

**Rules**:
- DateRangeID = `YYYYMMDD` (open date, 8 chars) + `MMDDD` (year-end month+day, 4 chars) → e.g., `202603101231` = opened 2026-03-10, closes 2026-12-31
- When an attribute changes, the SP updates DateRangeID of the existing row to close it (right 4 chars become yesterday's MMDD), then inserts a new row with today's open date + year-end
- To get the **most current row** per customer: `RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4) = '1231'`
- On January 1st: all prior year's open rows are closed (12-31) and re-opened for the new year
- The `Dim_Range` dimension table stores FromDateID + ToDateID for each DateRangeID

### 2.2 IsValidCustomer — Segment Flag

**What**: Computed flag indicating whether a customer is a "valid" retail customer for analytics (excludes demo, blocked countries, excluded labels).

**Columns Involved**: `IsValidCustomer`, `PlayerLevelID`, `LabelID`, `CountryID`

**Rules** (as of post-2020-03-14):
```
IsValidCustomer = 1 IF:
  PlayerLevelID <> 4 (not demo)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (30, 26) (not internal/excluded label)
  AND CountryID <> 250 (not blocked country)
ELSE 0
```
Pre-2020-03-14 rule additionally excluded AccountTypeID=9.

### 2.3 IsCreditReportValidCB — Credit Reporting Flag

**What**: Flag indicating whether a customer is eligible for credit report validation (CB = CreditBureau context).

**Columns Involved**: `IsCreditReportValidCB`, `PlayerLevelID`, `AccountTypeID`, `LabelID`, `CountryID`

**Rules** (as of post-2020-03-14):
```
IsCreditReportValidCB = 1 IF:
  NOT (PlayerLevelID = 4 AND AccountTypeID <> 2)  (not non-real demo)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (26, 30)
  AND NOT (CountryID = 250 AND CID NOT IN (3400616, 10526243))
ELSE 0
```

### 2.4 RegulationID — End-of-Day Rule

**What**: A customer's regulatory jurisdiction is taken from RegulationChangeLog (end-of-day change), NOT from the back-office system (immediate change), because regulation changes take effect at end of day for business/legal reasons.

**Columns Involved**: `RegulationID`, sourced from `Ext_FSC_BackOffice_RegulationChangeLog.ToRegulationID`

### 2.5 GDPR Erasure Masking

**What**: When a GDPR deletion request is processed, the UserName in Customer Core gets a `DelUserName` prefix. The SP detects this and masks Email, City, Address, Zip, and PhoneNumber in Fact_SnapshotCustomer.

**Columns Involved**: `Email`, `City`, `Address`, `Zip`, `PhoneNumber`

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, HASH(RealCID) distribution + CCI makes per-customer aggregations and filters on RealCID highly efficient — queries that filter or join on RealCID benefit from colocation. The NCI on RealCID provides efficient point-lookup for single customers.

**Warning**: With 406M rows, full table scans are expensive. Always filter by DateRangeID or a specific year range when possible.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage

**In Databricks**, the data is accessed via `V_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_FromDateID` (generic_id=1115), not directly. Two UC targets:
- `pii_data.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_v_fact_snapshotcustomer_fromdateid` — full PII (gated access)
- `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_v_fact_snapshotcustomer_fromdateid_masked` — Email/City/Address/Zip masked

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Current state for all customers | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` |
| Current state for one customer | `WHERE RealCID = @cid AND RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` |
| Customer state on a specific date | `WHERE RealCID = @cid AND LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),8) <= @date AND RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) >= RIGHT(@date, 4)` |
| Count of depositors | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231' AND IsDepositor = 1` |
| Valid retail customers | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231' AND IsValidCustomer = 1` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Country | ON f.CountryID = dc.CountryID | Country name/region |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Label | ON f.LabelID = dl.LabelID | Brand/label name |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Language | ON f.LanguageID = dl.LanguageID | Customer language |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_VerificationLevel | ON f.VerificationLevelID = dv.VerificationLevelID | KYC verification status |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_PlayerStatus | ON f.PlayerStatusID = dp.PlayerStatusID | Account lifecycle status |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Regulation | ON f.RegulationID = dr.RegulationID | Regulatory jurisdiction |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_AccountStatus | ON f.AccountStatusID = das.AccountStatusID | Account enabled/disabled |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Range | ON f.DateRangeID = dr.DateRangeID | Decode FromDateID + ToDateID |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_Guru_Copiers | ON f.RealCID = fg.RealCID | Copy-trading activity |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **DateRangeID is NOT a date** — it is a 12-digit bigint encoding (FromDate)(ToDate MMDD). Always extract with LEFT(...,8) for FromDate and RIGHT(...,4) for ToDate MMDD.
- **Most-current-row filter**: `RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` gets the currently open row, but after year-end closure this may temporarily return 0 rows. Use `MAX(DateRangeID)` per RealCID as a safer alternative.
- **Legacy columns with 0 defaults**: DemoCID, CustomerChangeTypeID, CurentValue, PreviousValue, DocsOK, Bankruptcy, PremiumAccount, Evangelist are all DEFAULT 0 and NOT populated by the current SP. Do not rely on them.
- **PII masking**: Email, City, Address, Zip are dynamically masked (`MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'default()')`). Users without `UNMASK` permission see NULL. PhoneNumber is NOT masked at DDL level but is GDPR-erased via the SP for deleted users.
- **WeekendFeePrecentage** (note: typo in column name — "Precentage" instead of "Percentage") — use as-is.
- **AccountStatusID distribution**: 1=93.2% (Active), 0=6.1% (unknown/default), 2=0.9% (Inactive). Only 3 distinct values observed.
- **Not exported directly to UC** — join via `V_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_FromDateID` in UC.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_Range is a DWH-internal helper lookup that pre-computes all possible (FromDate, ToDate) date range pairs needed by the Snapshot analytics pipelines. Each row represents a unique start-to-end date interval, identified by a composite BigInt key (DateRangeID). The table enables efficient range-based JOINs in SnapshotEquity and SnapshotCustomer views without requiring date arithmetic at query time.

This table has no external production source. It is generated entirely within the DWH by SP_Fact_SnapshotEquity and SP_Fact_SnapshotCustomer, which INSERT new DateRangeID combinations as they encounter new date pairs during snapshot processing. The pattern is append-only - new rows are added daily but existing rows are never updated or deleted.

As of 2026-03-10, the table contains approximately 1.3 million date range pairs spanning from 2007-01-01 to 2026-03-10 on the FromDate side, and 2007-08-26 to 2026-12-31 on the ToDate side.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 DateRangeID Encoding

**What**: DateRangeID is a deterministic composite key encoding both FromDate and MMDD(ToDate) into a single 12-digit BigInt.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `FromDateID`, `ToDateID`

**Rules**:
- Formula: `DateRangeID = CONCAT(YYYYMMDD(FromDate), MMDD(ToDate))`
- Example: FromDateID=20070101, ToDateID=20071231 -> DateRangeID=200701011231
- Decoding FromDateID: `CONVERT(INT, LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 8))`
- Decoding ToDateID: `CONVERT(INT, LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4) + RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4))`
- The YEAR component of ToDateID is always the SAME as the YEAR of FromDateID (only MMDD of ToDate is stored in the last 4 digits)

**Diagram**:
```
DateRangeID (12-digit BigInt):
  [ YYYY | MM | DD | MM | DD ]
  [  From Year  | From MMDD  | To MMDD ]
   |___________|             |________|
   Chars 1-8 = FromDateID    Chars 9-12 = MMDD(ToDate)

  ToDateID = YYYY(FromDate) + MMDD(ToDate)
  -> Year-end range example:
     FromDate=2020-03-15, ToDate=2020-12-31
     DateRangeID = 202003151231
     ToDateID    = 20201231
```

### 2.2 Snapshot Range Pattern

**What**: Dim_Range is the bridge between individual customer dates and fiscal/calendar year-end periods in Snapshot reports.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `FromDateID`, `ToDateID`

**Rules**:
- The primary use case is "from customer registration/event date to year-end": FromDate = customer's start date, ToDate = December 31 of that year
- The SPs also generate non-year-end ranges when snapshots require partial-period measurements
- The table grows daily as new snapshot dates are processed
- No deduplication needed - DateRangeID uniqueness is enforced by the NOT EXISTS check in both SPs

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with a composite CLUSTERED INDEX on (DateRangeID, FromDateID, ToDateID) and three Non-Clustered Indexes: IX_Dim_Range_FromDateID, IX_Dim_Range_ToDateID, and IX_Dim_Range_FromDateID_ToDateID. The NCI indexes are unusual for Synapse (which typically uses only CCI) and suggest heavy range-based lookups by the Snapshot SPs. Always filter on FromDateID or ToDateID directly to leverage these indexes.

Note: PRIMARY KEY (DateRangeID) is declared NOT ENFORCED - Synapse does not validate uniqueness but the ETL SPs maintain it via NOT EXISTS guards.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, the Gold export at `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_range` is Parquet. With 1.3M rows, consider filtering on FromDateID for performance.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Find the DateRangeID for a specific (from, to) pair | `SELECT DateRangeID FROM DWH_dbo.Dim_Range WHERE FromDateID = @from AND ToDateID = @to` |
| Find all ranges starting from a given date | `WHERE FromDateID = @date` (uses IX_Dim_Range_FromDateID) |
| Look up range details from a DateRangeID | `SELECT FromDateID, ToDateID FROM DWH_dbo.Dim_Range WHERE DateRangeID = @id` |
| Check how many ranges exist for a year | `WHERE FromDateID BETWEEN @year*10000+101 AND @year*10000+1231` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotEquity | DateRangeID | Resolve snapshot equity date ranges |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer | DateRangeID | Resolve snapshot customer date ranges |
| DWH_dbo.V_Fact_SnapshotEquity | DateRangeID | View-level access to snapshot equity with resolved ranges |
| DWH_dbo.V_M2M_Date_DateRange | DateRangeID | Month-to-month date range bridging |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **ToDate YEAR = FromDate YEAR**: The DateRangeID encoding only stores MMDD of ToDate. The year of ToDate is derived from FromDate's year. This means all ranges in this table are within-year ranges - cross-year ranges cannot be represented.
- **INSERT-only, no TRUNCATE**: Both writer SPs use NOT EXISTS guards, making the table append-only. Rows are never deleted. If a DateRangeID is erroneously created, it persists forever.
- **Primary key NOT ENFORCED**: Synapse does not verify uniqueness of DateRangeID. Trust the ETL logic, not the constraint.
- **DateRangeID is a STRING-derived number**: Always treat DateRangeID as a derived key, not a business ID. Decode using LEFT/RIGHT string operations if needed.
- **1.3M rows for a dim table**: Larger than typical dimensions. REPLICATE is appropriate given daily Snapshot SP joins from all distributions.

## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Dim_Manager` is the reference table for eToro's BackOffice customer-success managers -- the people (support agents, account managers, team leaders) assigned to serve customer accounts. A customer account typically has an assigned ManagerID that identifies the primary relationship owner in the BackOffice/CRM system.

The table holds 5,152 rows: 1,367 currently active managers (`IsActive=True`) including 1 active team leader, plus 3,785 historical/departed managers (`IsActive=False`). Since rows are never deleted, the table preserves the full history of everyone who has ever been a manager in the system.

Key columns: `FirstName`, `LastName` (personal details), `IsActive` (currently employed/assigned), `IsTeamLeader` (hierarchy flag), `SFManagerID` (Salesforce CRM ID, 18-char), `CalendlyID` (scheduling link). The `UserGroup` and `ParentUserGroup` columns are **not populated** -- both are hardcoded to `'Not Available'` in the ETL SP.

ETL pattern: `SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse` -- loads a staging intermediate (`Ext_Dim_Manager`) from `DWH_staging.etoro_BackOffice_Manager`, then merges into `Dim_Manager` (UPDATE existing rows, INSERT new rows). A post-load UPDATE sets `SFManagerID` from the Salesforce-to-BackOffice mapping table.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Incremental Merge Pattern (Soft-Delete)

**What**: Unlike most DWH Dim tables that use TRUNCATE+INSERT, Dim_Manager uses an incremental UPDATE+INSERT pattern that preserves historical manager records.

**Rules**:
- **UPDATE**: Existing ManagerID rows are updated with current FirstName, LastName, IsTeamLeader, IsActive, CalendlyID. This means a manager's name, active status, or team-leader flag can change.
- **INSERT**: New ManagerIDs from `etoro_BackOffice_Manager` that do not exist in Dim_Manager are appended. `InsertDate` is set to GETDATE() on first insert only.
- **No DELETE**: Managers who leave the company remain in the table with `IsActive=False`. The table is the full history of all managers.
- **SFManagerID**: Set via a separate post-load UPDATE joining to `SalesForce_DB_Prod_dbo_SalesForceToBOManagerMapping`. Managers not in Salesforce have NULL SFManagerID.

### 2.2 UserGroup / ParentUserGroup Not Populated

**What**: The DDL defines `UserGroup` and `ParentUserGroup` columns, but the ETL hardcodes both to `'Not Available'` for all rows.

**Rule**: Do not use `UserGroup` or `ParentUserGroup` for any analysis. Both columns have the literal string `'Not Available'` for every row. The intended team/group hierarchy data has not been implemented.

### 2.3 CalendlyID for Customer Scheduling

**What**: `CalendlyID` holds the manager's Calendly scheduling account identifier, used for customer-facing meeting booking.

**Rule**: Most inactive (historical) managers have `CalendlyID='etoro-club'`, suggesting a default value is set when a manager leaves the system rather than the CalendlyID being set to NULL. Active managers have their personal Calendly IDs. Do not use CalendlyID to infer active status.

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

REPLICATE-distributed (5,152 rows trivially replicated). HEAP -- no clustered index. PK_ManagerID is NOT ENFORCED (Synapse syntax; uniqueness is not guaranteed at the DB level, though duplicates are not expected). Zero JOIN overhead.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Get manager name for a customer account | `JOIN Dim_Manager ON ManagerID; SELECT FirstName, LastName` |
| Find all currently active managers | `WHERE IsActive = 1` (1,367 rows) |
| Find active team leaders | `WHERE IsActive = 1 AND IsTeamLeader = 1` (1 row currently) |
| Cross-reference with Salesforce | `WHERE SFManagerID IS NOT NULL` |

### 3.3 Gotchas

- **UserGroup = 'Not Available'**: Both `UserGroup` and `ParentUserGroup` are hardcoded placeholder strings. Do not use for grouping or filtering.
- **3,785 inactive managers**: Always filter `WHERE IsActive = 1` for current-state analysis. Leaving out this filter inflates manager counts 4x.
- **CalendlyID default 'etoro-club'**: This is a default value for departed/inactive managers, not a real Calendly account. Filter on IsActive=1 for meaningful CalendlyID usage.
- **HEAP index**: Full table scans on all queries. Acceptable at 5,152 rows.
- **PK NOT ENFORCED**: No database-level guarantee against duplicate ManagerIDs. Validate if using ManagerID as a join key in data quality checks.
- **SFManagerID is NULL for many managers**: Only managers that appear in the Salesforce-to-BackOffice mapping have SFManagerID populated.

### Confidence Tier Legend

| Stars | Tier | Tag |
|-------|------|-----|
| ★★★ | Tier 2 -- Synapse SP code / DDL | `(Tier 2 -- SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse)` |
| ★★ | Tier 3 -- live data / structure | `(Tier 3 -- live data)` |

| # | Element | Type | Nullable | Description |
|---|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | ManagerID | int | NO | Auto-generated unique integer identifier for each BackOffice staff member. PK for the entire BackOffice authorization system. ManagerID=0 is the reserved System account; ManagerID=1 is the bootstrap Admin. All BackOffice action tables (BackOffice.Customer, Task, Downtime, etc.) store ManagerID as the 'acting staff' reference. (Tier 1 — BackOffice.Manager) |
| 2 | UserGroup | varchar(50) | NO | Hardcoded to 'Not Available' for all rows. The ETL SP sets this to a literal constant: `'Not Available' as UserGroup`. Intended to represent the manager's team/group but not populated. Do not use. (Tier 3 — SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse) |
| 3 | ParentUserGroup | varchar(50) | NO | Hardcoded to 'Not Available' for all rows. Same as UserGroup -- intended to represent the manager's parent team hierarchy but not populated. Do not use. (Tier 3 — SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse) |
| 4 | FirstName | varchar(50) | NO | Staff member's first name. Combined with LastName in views and procedures to produce display names (e.g., BackOffice.GetMyCustomers sets [Manager] = FirstName + ' ' + LastName). (Tier 1 — BackOffice.Manager) |
| 5 | LastName | varchar(50) | NO | Staff member's last name. Combined with FirstName for display. LastName='*' indicates a functional/shared account (e.g., the generic 'support' account). (Tier 1 — BackOffice.Manager) |
| 6 | IsActive | bit | NO | Logical soft-delete flag controlling login access and visibility. 1=active (staff currently employed, can authenticate). 0=deactivated (former staff or suspended; LOGIN is blocked). Do NOT physically delete manager rows — use IsActive=0 to preserve audit history. (Tier 1 — BackOffice.Manager) |
| 7 | IsTeamLeader | bit | NO | Marks this manager as a team leader within their department. 1=team leader role. 0=individual contributor. Used in LoadManagers/LoadManagerByUsername responses for role-based UI rendering. (Tier 1 — BackOffice.Manager) |
| 8 | DWHManagerID | int | YES | Always equal to ManagerID. Standard DWH DWH{X}ID redundancy pattern. Do not use for JOINs. (Tier 2 — SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse) |
| 9 | StatusID | int | YES | Hardcoded to 1 for all rows. Conveys no business information. (Tier 2 — SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse) |
| 10 | UpdateDate | datetime | YES | ETL run timestamp for the most recent UPDATE that touched this row. Set to GETDATE() on every daily UPDATE. Reflects last ETL run, not production modification. (Tier 2 — SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse) |
| 11 | InsertDate | datetime | YES | ETL run timestamp when the manager row was first inserted into Dim_Manager. Set once on INSERT; not updated on subsequent runs. Unlike most DWH tables, this may reflect the actual first-appearance date for the manager. (Tier 2 — SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse) |
| 12 | SFManagerID | nvarchar(18) | YES | Salesforce CRM 18-character object ID for this manager (e.g., 0050800000DitvwAAB). Set via post-load UPDATE from SalesForce_DB_Prod_dbo_SalesForceToBOManagerMapping. NULL for managers not present in the Salesforce mapping. (Tier 2 — SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse) |
| 13 | CalendlyID | nvarchar(50) | YES | Calendly scheduling identifier for this manager. Exposed via GetManagers procedure for the customer-facing scheduler that lets customers book calls with their account manager. (Tier 1 — BackOffice.Manager) |

- **Wiki path**: `C:\Users\guyman\Documents\github\Databricks_Knowledge\knowledge\synapse\Wiki\BI_DB_dbo\Tables\BI_DB_PositionPnL.md`

# BI_DB_dbo.BI_DB_PositionPnL

## 1. Overview

Daily end-of-day snapshot of **open trading positions** with unrealized P&L, rates, commissions, NOP, and close-price metrics. Grain is **one row per position per calendar day** (`DateID` + `PositionID`); only positions open as of end of `@dt` appear for that `DateID`.

## 2. Business Context

- **Rules**: Positions are sourced from `DWH_dbo.Dim_Position` with `OpenDateID < @ReportDateID` and still open on `@dt` (`CloseDateID >= @ReportDateID` or `CloseDateID = 0`). `Dim_PositionChangeLog` rewinds `Amount`, `StopRate`, `AmountInUnitsDecimal`, and `IsSettled` when changes occur after `@dt`; rows with partial-close child (`ChangeTypeID = 11`) after `@dt` are removed. Stock splits adjust `InitForexRate`, units, and EOD rates via `Dim_HistorySplitRatio` and `#Prices`. **PositionPnL** is `PnLInDollars` from Dim_Position (authoritative PnL engine) since 2024-03-24; **Price** and **NOP** still use SP formulas from EOD rates and `Dim_Instrument` FX chains. **DailyPnL** is updated after load as today `PositionPnL` minus prior day `PositionPnL` per `PositionID`.
- **Consumers**: Finance and CMR reporting; downstream BI_DB procedures and views (e.g. crypto zero / loan / NOP stacks, IFRS, compliance, dashboards) read this table as the canonical daily position P&L snapshot.

## 5. Relationships

**Source tables (ETL read path)**

| Source | Role |
|--------|------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Position | Open positions, PnL dollars, fees, close/current rates, core attributes |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_CurrencyPriceWithSplit | Latest bid/ask before `@ReportDate` per instrument |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_HistorySplitRatio | Split boundaries and ratios for rate/unit adjustment |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_PositionChangeLog | Rewind deletes/updates for post-`@dt` changes |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Instrument (+ self-joins / #Prices) | Instrument currency pair and USD cross for Price and NOP |

**Consumers (representative)**

Includes finance and CMR pipelines and many BI_DB dependents such as **`BI_DB_Crypto_Zero`**, **`BI_DB_Real_Crypto_Loan`**, **`BI_DB_DailyZero_TreeSize_NEW`** (and related daily zero / NOP procedures), plus roll-over and dividend logic (**`SP_RollOverFee_Dividends`** reads prior-day `AmountInUnitsDecimal`), IFRS, compliance, and diagnostics. Confirm additional references with a repo search on `BI_DB_PositionPnL`.

## 6. ETL & Lifecycle

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Writer** | `BI_DB_dbo.SP_PositionPnL` @dt |
| **OpsDB** | Priority **99**, ProcessType **4** (FinanceReportSPS), frequency **Daily** |
| **Pattern** | Build `#UnrealizedPnL` -- create `BI_DB_PositionPnL_SWITCH_SINGLE` with same distribution/index/partition scheme as main table -- `INSERT ... SELECT` from `#UnrealizedPnL` -- `SP_BI_DB_PositionPnL_SWITCH` partition swap -- `UPDATE` **DailyPnL** vs previous `DateID` |
| **Grain** | One row per open `PositionID` per `DateID` |
| **Delete scope** | Daily partition replaced via switch for the target `DateID` (not a full-table DELETE) |

## 7. Query Advisory

- **Partition elimination**: Always filter **`WHERE DateID = ...` or a tight `DateID` range**; scanning all daily partitions is prohibitively expensive.
- **Distribution**: **`PositionID`** is the hash key -- joins and GROUP BY on `PositionID` minimize movement; filtering large sets by `CID` alone may benefit from **`IX_BI_DB_PositionPnL_CID (DateID, CID)`** when present.
- **Semantics**: Table holds **open** positions only for each snapshot date; closed-position economics live in `Dim_Position` / fact tables.
- **DailyPnL**: Populated in a second step; for intraday copies of switch tables, expect NULL until the main-table UPDATE runs.

## 8. Classification & Status

## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Dim_Mirror` is the DWH's primary record of all copy-trading relationships on the eToro platform. A "mirror" is the connection established when Customer A (the copier, `CID`) chooses to copy Customer B (the copied person, `ParentCID`/`ParentUserName`). Once established, trades opened by B are automatically mirrored proportionally in A's account, scaled to the mirror's `Amount`.

The table covers the full history of eToro's social trading product from its earliest CopyTrader relationships in 2011 through the present. It holds 11,145,368 rows across four mirror types: Regular copy (85.2%), Fund mirrors (14.1%), CopyMe/Popular Investor (0.7%), and Smart Portfolio/Social Index (0.001%).

**ETL pattern**: Incremental daily differential. The SP (`SP_Dim_Mirror_DL_To_Synapse`) merges updates from two staging sources:
1. `etoro_Trade_Mirror` -- real-time active mirrors (open positions)
2. `etoro_History_Mirror` -- historical/closed mirrors (close events with final P&L)

Rows are never deleted from Dim_Mirror (except for same-day re-processing). The `CloseDateID=0` / `CloseOccurred='1900-01-01'` sentinel marks currently open mirrors.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Open vs. Closed Mirror Sentinel

**What**: A mirror may be open (still actively copying) or closed. The SP uses sentinel values to distinguish open mirrors from closed ones.

**Columns Involved**: `CloseOccurred`, `CloseDateID`, `IsActive`

**Rules**:
- **Open mirror**: `CloseDateID = 0`, `CloseOccurred = '1900-01-01 00:00:00'`. This is the active sentinel -- the copier is still copying.
- **Closed mirror**: `CloseDateID > 0`, `CloseOccurred` = actual close datetime. The copier stopped copying.
- **IsActive**: Production flag from Trade.Mirror / History.Mirror. Can be 0 for rows where `CloseDateID=0` (e.g., paused or deactivated but not formally closed). Do not rely on IsActive alone for open/closed filtering -- use `CloseDateID = 0`.
- **For filtering active mirrors**: `WHERE CloseDateID = 0` (669,921 currently open: 468,911 Regular + 9 CopyMe + 201,001 Fund)

### 2.2 Dual-Source ETL (Real vs. History)

**What**: Open mirrors come from `Trade.Mirror` (real-time system table); closed mirrors come from `History.Mirror` (event log). The daily SP merges both.

**Rules**:
- `etoro_Trade_Mirror` provides the current state of each open mirror (IsActive, Amount, risk settings, running P&L).
- `etoro_History_Mirror MirrorOperationID=2` provides close events (CloseOccurred, CloseDateID, RealziedPnL at close).
- `etoro_History_Mirror MirrorOperationID=1` provides open events (SessionID at open time).
- When a mirror appears in both History (closed today) and Real (still shown as open), History takes precedence (duplicates removed).
- Close dates with CloseOccurred >= today are treated as still-open and get sentinel values (1900-01-01, CloseDateID=0).

### 2.3 IsCopyFundMirror Derivation

**What**: `IsCopyFundMirror` identifies mirrors where the copied entity is an eToro-managed fund account, not a regular customer.

**Rule**: `IsCopyFundMirror = 1` when `ParentCID` is in `etoro_BackOffice_Customer WHERE AccountTypeID = 9` (Fund account type). NULL/0 for regular customer-to-customer copies. Fund mirrors are a distinct product from the Regular CopyTrader relationship.

### 2.4 RealziedPnL Typo

**What**: The column `RealziedPnL` contains the realized profit/loss for the mirror (net profit at close). The column name has a persistent typo ("Realzied" instead of "Realized") that exists in both the DDL and the SP.

**Rule**: This column is populated from `History.Mirror.NetProfit` at close time. For open mirrors, it reflects the running net profit at the last SP update. Always reference as `RealziedPnL` (with the typo) in queries -- the DDL name is authoritative.

### 2.5 MirrorSL and Risk Controls

**What**: Copy-trading relationships can have a stop-loss that automatically closes the mirror if losses exceed a threshold.

**Columns Involved**: `MirrorSL`, `MirrorSLPercentage`, `PauseCopy`

**Rules**:
- `MirrorSL`: Stop-loss amount in absolute USD terms. Mirror closes if cumulative loss reaches this amount.
- `MirrorSLPercentage`: Stop-loss as percentage of `InitialInvestment`. A setting of 40 means "close mirror if I lose 40% of my initial investment".
- `PauseCopy`: 1 if the copier has paused the copy (no new trades are mirrored). Paused copies are still open (CloseDateID=0) but not actively mirroring new trades.

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**HASH(MirrorID)**: MirrorID is the distribution key. JOINs on MirrorID are co-located (no shuffle). JOINs on CID, ParentCID, or OpenDateID may require broadcast/shuffle -- consider the fact table's distribution when planning multi-table JOINs.

**CLUSTERED INDEX (OpenDateID, MirrorID)**: Optimized for date-filtered queries on OpenDateID + MirrorID lookup. The two NC indexes support:
- `IX_Dim_Mirror`: OpenOccurred scans (datetime-based open date filtering)
- `IX_Dim_Mirror_ParentCID`: ParentCID lookups (find all copiers of a given Popular Investor)

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Count currently active copy relationships | `WHERE CloseDateID = 0 AND MirrorTypeID = 1` |
| Find all copiers of a specific Popular Investor | `WHERE ParentCID = X AND MirrorTypeID IN (1, 2)` |
| Mirror P&L attribution | `JOIN Dim_Mirror ON MirrorID; SELECT RealziedPnL, InitialInvestment` |
| Date-range analysis of new copy relationships | `WHERE OpenDateID BETWEEN 20250101 AND 20250131` |
| Identify copies with stop-loss set | `WHERE MirrorSL > 0 OR MirrorSLPercentage > 0` |
| Find paused copies | `WHERE PauseCopy = 1 AND CloseDateID = 0` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_MirrorType | `ON MirrorTypeID` | Get copy type name (Regular, CopyMe, Social Index, Fund) |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Date | `ON OpenDateID` or `CloseDateID` | Calendar metadata for open/close dates |
| CustomerStatic (or similar) | `ON CID` | Copier customer details |
| CustomerStatic | `ON ParentCID` | Copied person (Popular Investor) details |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **CloseOccurred='1900-01-01' = open mirror**: Do NOT interpret this as a historical date. It is the ETL sentinel for "not yet closed". Filter `WHERE CloseDateID = 0` for open mirrors.
- **RealziedPnL has a typo**: Column name is `RealziedPnL` (not `RealizedPnL`). This is the authoritative DDL name -- use the typo in queries.
- **IsActive is not a reliable closed indicator**: Use `CloseDateID = 0` for "is open". IsActive can be 0 for open-but-paused mirrors.
- **11.1M rows, never truncated**: Full table scans are expensive. Always filter on `OpenDateID` (clustered key) or `MirrorID` (distribution/hash key) for efficient queries.
- **MirrorTypeID=3 (Social Index) only 122 rows**: This product type has minimal representation -- likely a legacy or very limited product.
- **IsCopyFundMirror NULL vs 0**: The column can be NULL (not set in older rows) or 0/1. `ISNULL(IsCopyFundMirror, 0) = 1` for fund mirror filtering.
- **SessionID NULL for old rows**: The SessionID column was added later; historical mirrors (pre-2011 to early 2020s) may have NULL SessionID.

## 1. Business Meaning

`V_Liabilities` is the platform's primary view for computing what eToro owes each customer (liabilities) and how much of the customer's balance is "real" vs promotional credit.

**Core formula** — let `NetEquity = TotalPositionsAmount + TotalCash + TotalStockOrders + PositionPnL`:
- **ActualNWA** (Non-Withdrawable Amount): The portion of NetEquity covered by BonusCredit. Clamped to `[0, BonusCredit]`. If the customer's NetEquity exceeds their BonusCredit, ActualNWA = BonusCredit. If NetEquity goes negative, ActualNWA = 0.
- **Liabilities**: InProcessCashouts + the portion of NetEquity **above** BonusCredit. This is what eToro owes the customer — real money, not promotional credit.
- **Balance**: Liabilities + ActualNWA = RealizedEquity + PositionPnL (Confluence: "Summary of V-Liabilities")

**Business context** (from Confluence):
- "If clients lose money, their Actual NWA will reflect only what's left. A client has $1000, loses $200 → Actual NWA = $800. When they profit back to $2000 → Actual NWA = $1000 and Liabilities show $1000 bonus credit."
- The view excludes today's date because end-of-day snapshots (FSE + FCUPNL) must both be loaded before the view is meaningful.

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Join Structure

```
Fact_SnapshotEquity a                   -- daily equity snapshot per CID
  JOIN V_M2M_Date_DateRange b           -- expands DateRangeID → one row per calendar day (DateKey)
    ON a.DateRangeID = b.DateRangeID
  LEFT JOIN Fact_CustomerUnrealized_PnL c  -- daily PnL snapshot per CID
    ON a.CID = c.CID AND b.DateKey = c.DateModified
  LEFT JOIN Fact_Guru_Copiers gc        -- DEAD JOIN: no columns selected (Boris Slutski, 2021-01-11)
    ON a.CID = gc.CID AND b.DateKey = gc.DateID
WHERE b.DateKey < today
```

### 2.2 Computed Column Formulas

All computed columns use a common intermediate value:

```
NetEquity = ISNULL(TotalPositionsAmount, 0) + ISNULL(TotalCash, 0)
          + ISNULL(TotalStockOrders, 0) + ISNULL(PositionPnL, 0)
```

Note: `TotalStockOrders` is a legacy column hardcoded to 0 since 2019 (see Fact_SnapshotEquity wiki). Its presence in the formula is a historical artifact — it does not affect computation.

| Column | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| **ActualNWA** | `CASE WHEN NetEquity > BonusCredit THEN BonusCredit WHEN NetEquity < 0 THEN 0 ELSE NetEquity END` |
| **Liabilities** | `InProcessCashouts + CASE WHEN NetEquity - BonusCredit > 0 THEN NetEquity - BonusCredit WHEN NetEquity < 0 THEN NetEquity ELSE 0 END` |
| **WA_Liabilities** | `MIN(Liabilities_excl_cashouts, Credit)` — the portion of liabilities coverable by credit |
| **Liabilities_InUsedMargin** | `MAX(Liabilities_excl_cashouts - Credit, 0)` — liabilities exceeding available credit |
| **LiabilitiesStockReal** | `ISNULL(PositionPnLStocksReal, 0) + ISNULL(TotalRealStocks, 0)` |
| **LiabilitiesCryptoReal** | `ISNULL(PositionPnLCryptoReal, 0) + ISNULL(TotalRealCrypto, 0)` |
| **LiabilitiesCrypto_TRS** | `ISNULL(CryptoPositionPnL_TRS, 0) + ISNULL(Total_TRSCrypto, 0)` |
| **LiabilitiesFuturesReal** | `ISNULL(PositionPnLFuturesReal, 0) + ISNULL(TotalRealFutures, 0)` |
| **TotalStockManualPosition** | `TotalStockPositionAmount + TotalStockOrders - TotalMirrorStockPositionAmount` |
| **ManualStockPositionPnL** | `StocksPositionPnL - MirrorStocksPositionPnL` |
| **TotalCryptoManualPosition** | `TotalCryptoPositionAmount - TotalMirrorCryptoPositionAmount` |
| **TotalCryptoManualPosition_TRS** | `TotalCryptoPositionAmount_TRS - TotalMirrorCryptoPositionAmount_TRS` |

## 5. Query Advisory

- **Always filter by DateID** — the view contains the full history of daily snapshots. Unfiltered queries are expensive.
- **Balance formula**: `Liabilities + ActualNWA` or equivalently `ISNULL(RealizedEquity,0) + ISNULL(PositionPnL,0)` (Confluence)
- **TotalCash decomposition**: `TotalCash = Credit + TotalMirrorCash` (Confluence)
- **Today's data is excluded** — the WHERE clause filters `DateKey < today`. This is by design; use yesterday's date.
- **LEFT JOIN to FCUPNL**: PnL columns will be NULL for CIDs with no open positions on a given date. Use ISNULL when aggregating.

## 1. Business Meaning

`BI_DB_Investors_Unclustered` is a **daily investor activity report** providing a multi-dimensional aggregation of customer engagement across the eToro platform. Each row represents a unique combination of Date x AccountManager x Country x Regulation x ActionType x InstrumentType x AssetType, with counts of customers, net money invested, and assets under management/administration.

The table holds an estimated ~75M rows across ~1,926 daily snapshots from January 2021 to April 2026 (~37K rows per day). SP_InvestorReport processes three source streams:

1. **Manual**: Direct (non-copy) position activity -- open/close trades from Fact_CustomerAction (ActionTypeID 1=Open, 4=Close). AUA from BI_DB_PositionPnL (Amount + PositionPnL for non-mirror positions).
2. **Copy**: Copy-trading activity -- mirror-based investments from Dim_Mirror + Fact_CustomerAction (ActionTypeID 15-18). AUM from etoroGeneral_History_GuruCopiers (Cash + Investment + PnL + DetachedPosInvestment + Dit_PnL).
3. **Balance**: Cash balance positions -- uninvested credit from V_Liabilities (current day minus prior day for NetMI).

Each stream is aggregated by dimensional axes, then UNION'd into the final table.

### Relationship to BI_DB_Investors

This table is the **unclustered companion** to `BI_DB_Investors` (which adds a ClusterSF column from BI_DB_CID_DailyCluster). SP_InvestorReport populates both BI_DB_Investors_STG (staging) and this table. SP_InvestorReport_Cluster then reads STG to populate the clustered version. The Unclustered version starts from Jan 2021; the clustered version goes back to Jul 2019.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Three Source Streams

**What**: Activity is segmented into Manual, Copy, and Balance streams.
**Columns Involved**: ActionType, Customers, Amount, AUM_AUA
**Rules**:
- Manual: Direct position open/close from Fact_CustomerAction (ActionTypeID IN 1, 4). Customers = COUNT(DISTINCT CID), Amount = SUM(-1 * fca.Amount), AUA = SUM(BI_DB_PositionPnL.Amount + PositionPnL)
- Copy: Mirror-based copy trading from Dim_Mirror + Fact_CustomerAction (ActionTypeID IN 15, 16, 17, 18). Customers = COUNT(DISTINCT CID), Amount = SUM(fca.Amount * -1), AUM = SUM(GuruCopiers components)
- Balance: Cash positions from V_Liabilities. Customers = COUNT(CID), Amount = today's credit minus yesterday's credit, AUA = today's credit

### 2.2 Asset Type Classification

**What**: Classifies activity into investment vs trading vs non-invested vs copy.
**Columns Involved**: AssetType
**Rules**:
- 'Investment': InstrumentTypeID IN (4, 5, 6) AND Leverage < 3 -- long-term, low-leverage stock/ETF holding
- 'Trade': All other manual positions -- short-term/leveraged
- 'Copy': All copy-trading activity
- 'NonInvested': Balance stream (uninvested cash)

### 2.3 Instrument Type for Copy Stream

**What**: Copy stream uses MirrorTypeID to determine InstrumentType.
**Columns Involved**: InstrumentType
**Rules**:
- MirrorTypeID IN (1, 2) -> 'Copy Trading' (Regular, CopyMe)
- Other MirrorTypeID -> 'Copy Portfolio' (Smart Portfolio, Fund)

### 2.4 Customer Validity Filter

**What**: Only valid depositing customers are included.
**Columns Involved**: All rows
**Rules**:
- Fact_SnapshotCustomer.IsValidCustomer = 1
- Fact_SnapshotCustomer.IsDepositor = 1
- Dim_Range date boundaries: FromDateID <= @ddINT AND ToDateID >= @ddINT

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

ROUND_ROBIN with CLUSTERED INDEX on Date ASC. Large table (~75M rows). Always filter on Date or DateID for efficient index seeks.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Daily investor activity by regulation | `WHERE DateID = @date GROUP BY RegulationID` |
| AUM trend by country | `SELECT DateID, CountryID, SUM(AUM_AUA) GROUP BY DateID, CountryID` |
| Net money invested by instrument type | `WHERE DateID = @date GROUP BY InstrumentType` |
| Manual vs Copy activity comparison | `WHERE DateID = @date GROUP BY ActionType` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Regulation | RegulationID | Regulation name |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Country | CountryID | Country name |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_AccountManager | AccountManagerID | Account manager details |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **Large table**: ~75M rows -- always filter on Date or DateID. Without a date filter, queries scan the entire table
- **Amount = NetMI**: The DDL column "Amount" is populated from the SP's "NetMI" (Net Money Invested) field. The naming mismatch can be confusing
- **AUM_AUA dual meaning**: Maps to AUM for Copy streams (mirror portfolio value) and AUA for Manual/Balance streams (position value or cash credit). The semantic distinction is collapsed into one column
- **Customers count inconsistency**: Manual/Copy use COUNT(DISTINCT CID), Balance uses COUNT(CID) -- potential double-counting in Balance if a CID appears in multiple balance rows
- **No ClusterSF**: Unlike BI_DB_Investors, this table has no Salesforce cluster dimension. Use BI_DB_Investors if cluster-level analysis is needed
- **Index on Date not DateID**: The clustered index is on the `Date` column (date type), not `DateID` (int). Filter on `Date` for optimal index usage, or on `DateID` for semantic clarity (both map 1:1)
