# Regen Harness — Writer Prompt

# Regen Harness — Writer (single-object mode)

You are running the DWH Semantic Documentation pipeline on **ONE OBJECT** in
isolated regen-harness mode. This is NOT the normal batch loop. You are NOT
reading `_index.md`, NOT updating any index file, NOT processing other
objects, NOT running cross-schema sync. You document one object end-to-end and
exit.

---

## ⛔ MCP PRE-FLIGHT — MANDATORY

Before reading any rule files or DDL:

1. Call `mcp__synapse_sql__execute_sql_read_only` with `SELECT 1 AS mcp_preflight`.
2. **If it fails or the tool does not exist**: print `REGEN ABORT: Synapse MCP unavailable` and **EXIT IMMEDIATELY**. A wiki without live data sampling is INCOMPLETE and WILL FAIL the adversarial judge.
3. **If it succeeds**: print `MCP PRE-FLIGHT: PASS` and continue.

No exceptions. No "code-only documentation" fallback. No "I'll skip Phase 2 because the table looks dormant" — the judge sees the dormant footer too and will fail you for missing data evidence.

---

## ⛔ REGEN-HARNESS BREVITY OVERRIDE

This is a regen-harness run; we are optimising for token efficiency. The judge's
HARD assertions (8 sections present; ETL diagram in 5.2; Element table shape; row
count = DDL column count; Tier suffix on every Element row) all REMAIN MANDATORY.
Soft prose around them is CAPPED — defer to these caps even when the
GOLDEN-REFERENCE example (Dim_Mirror) shows verbose prose.

| Section | Cap |
|---|---|
| 1. Business Meaning | <=120 words. One paragraph. Must include row count, date range, ETL SP, source. |
| 2. Business Logic | <=2 subsections; each <=80 words What/Columns/Rules. Skip section entirely if no non-trivial logic. |
| 3.1 Distribution & Index | <=2 sentences. |
| 3.2 Common Query Patterns | Table only, max 3 rows, no commentary. |
| 3.3 Common JOINs | Table only, max 3 rows, no commentary. |
| 3.4 Gotchas | <=4 bullets, one line each. |
| 4. Elements | Each row Description: ONE sentence ending `(Tier N — source)`. No multi-sentence per-column descriptions. Inline dictionary values when <=15 distinct (per GOLDEN-REFERENCE Section C). |
| 5.2 ETL Pipeline | Diagram + 1 sentence below. No additional prose. |
| 6. Relationships | Tables only, no prose around them. |
| 7. Sample Queries | EXACTLY 2 queries. One sentence header each, no explanation paragraph. |
| 8. Atlassian Knowledge | Bullets only. |

These caps cut output from ~22K tokens to ~10K tokens per object. Keep the
information density HIGH, drop the explanation/narrative prose. The wiki is for
analysts and AI agents who already know the domain — they do not need essay-style
context.

---

## ⛔ PHASE 3 DISTRIBUTION CAP

Phase 3 (distribution analysis) is capped at **at most 3 categorical columns**
per object. Pick those whose names match the regex
`Status|Type|Code|Country|Region|Currency|Category|Reg|Score|Group|Kind|Class`.
Skip free-text columns entirely (Email, Description, Comment, Note, Address,
Name, Url, Subject, Body, Reason).

If fewer than 3 columns match the regex, run distribution queries on however
many DO match — running zero distribution queries is OK if the table has no
obviously-categorical columns.

---

## ⛔ OUTPUT DIRECTORY GUARANTEE

The directory listed under **Absolute output directory** in the Object Header
ALREADY EXISTS, was created by the harness, and is empty (apart from the
writer_prompt.md you are reading). DO NOT run `Bash ls` to check it. DO NOT
run `Bash mkdir`. Just call `Write` directly with the absolute paths from the
Object Header for the three required files.

---

## ⛔ PRE-RESOLVED UPSTREAM CONTEXT — your Tier 1 inheritance source is below, USE IT

The block titled **"## PRE-RESOLVED UPSTREAM BUNDLE"** in this prompt was
assembled **deterministically by the harness, before you started**. It contains:

- The **DDL** for the object you are documenting (verbatim from SSDT).
- Every **upstream wiki** the harness could resolve from the existing
  `.lineage.md` plus DDL-derived references — both local Synapse wikis and
  remote production-DB wikis (DB_Schema, ExperianceDBs, etc.).
- For any stored procedure mentioned in the lineage, the **SP source code**
  pulled from `DataPlatform\SynapseSQLPool1\sql_dp_prod_we\...`.

**Treat this bundle as your AUTHORITATIVE source for Tier 1 inheritance.** You
are NOT permitted to claim "no upstream wiki could be found" if the bundle
contains one. You ARE permitted to read additional files via the `Read` tool
if you need more context.

### Tier rules — re-stated, NON-NEGOTIABLE

For every column in the object:

1. **Passthrough or rename WITH upstream wiki present in the bundle** →
   **Tier 1**. Description MUST be a verbatim quote from the upstream wiki.
   Do not paraphrase. Do not "improve". Do not generalize vendor names. Do not
   drop NULL semantics. The judge will run a character-by-character
   comparison.
2. **ETL-computed** (CASE / arithmetic / aggregation visible in the SP source) →
   **Tier 2** with the transform stated.
3. **Dim-lookup passthrough** (`SELECT dim.X` with no transform AND `Dim_X`
   has its own Tier 1 origin documented in the bundle) → **Tier 1 with the
   dim's origin** (e.g. `Dictionary.Country`), NOT `Tier 2 via SP_X` and NOT
   `Tier 1 via Dim_X` (Dim_X is a relay, not a root). Quote the dim's wiki
   verbatim.
4. **No source traceable from bundle, DDL, JOINs, or SP source** →
   **Tier 3** with explicit reason. Be specific: "PII column, no upstream wiki
   located, name suggests …".
5. **`Tier 4 — inferred from name`** is BANNED unless the bundle explicitly
   shows the column has no upstream and no SP code touches it. Lazy Tier 4 is
   the #1 reason wikis fail the judge. If you are tempted to write Tier 4
   with no other evidence, you have skipped Phase 9 — go back and read the
   SP source in the bundle.

### Footer rules

- If the bundle contains AT LEAST ONE upstream wiki: the footer MUST identify
  the production source(s). Writing `Production Source: Unknown (dormant)`
  when the bundle proves an upstream exists is an automatic fail.
- If `_no_upstream_found.txt` exists in the regen folder: it is OK to mark
  the table as dormant in the footer, but you MUST still ground every column
  description in the DDL + SP code rather than `Tier 4 — inferred`.

---

## Output paths — write here, NOT into the main wiki tree

Write all THREE output files into:

```
audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/
  {Object}.md
  {Object}.lineage.md
  {Object}.review-needed.md
```

`{Schema}`, `{Object}`, and `{N}` are passed in via the prompt header below.

**DO NOT** write into `knowledge/synapse/Wiki/` under any circumstances. The
main tree is read-only for this run. **DO NOT** modify `_index.md` or any
`_batch_context.json`. **DO NOT** generate `.alter.sql`. **DO NOT** run Phase
16 — the adversarial judge runs as a separate, fresh claude process AFTER you
exit. Pretending to evaluate yourself wastes tokens.

---

## Pipeline scope for this single object

Run phases 1 through 11 inclusive. Skip Phase 16. Skip Phase 11W (no ALTER).
Skip cross-object index updates. Skip `_batch_context.json` writes.

Required phase gates (you must print them as you complete each):

```
PHASE GATE — {Schema}.{Object}:
  [x] P1 DDL          [x] P2 Sample        [x] P3 Dist
  [x] P4 Lookup       [x] P5 JOIN          [x] P6 BizLogic
  [x] P7 Views        [x] P8 SP-scan       [x] P9 SP-logic
  [x] P9B ETL         [x] P10 Jira         [x] P10A Upstream
  [x] P10B Lineage    → Ready for P11
```

If a phase truly cannot run (e.g. no SPs reference the table), mark it `[-]`
with a one-line reason. Skipping P2 or P3 because "the table is small" is
NOT a valid reason — sample it.

---

## Outputs — three files, exact shape

Follow the GOLDEN-REFERENCE in
`.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/GOLDEN-REFERENCE.mdc`.

1. **`{Object}.lineage.md`** — written FIRST (Phase 10B). Source Objects
   table + Column Lineage table. Every Tier 1 row must point to a file in the
   pre-resolved bundle (or to a wiki you read independently).
2. **`{Object}.md`** — the main wiki, 8 sections, every column in
   Section 4's Elements table, every description ending with
   `(Tier N — source)`.
3. **`{Object}.review-needed.md`** — items needing human review. MUST NOT
   contain a `## 4. Elements` section.

---

## Final checklist before exiting

Print, verbatim:

```
OUTPUT CHECK — {Schema}.{Object}:
  [x] .lineage.md    written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.lineage.md
  [x] .md            written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.md
  [x] .review-needed.md written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.review-needed.md
  [-] .alter.sql     deferred (regen harness — judge runs next)
  Tier1 columns: N    Tier2: N    Tier3: N    Tier4: N
  Bundle inheritance used: YES/NO  (NO is only valid if `_no_upstream_found.txt` exists)
```

Then EXIT. Do not run a self-evaluation. Do not "double-check by re-reading
the wiki you just wrote". Do not append a verdict block. The judge runs in a
separate process with its own context.

# build-wiki-bidb-batch

You are running the DWH Semantic Documentation pipeline for schema BI_DB_dbo.
**Wiki-only mode** — generate documentation files only. ALTER scripts are generated separately later via `/generate-alter-dwh`.

## ⛔ MCP PRE-FLIGHT — NON-NEGOTIABLE, CHECK BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

Before loading rules, before reading the index, before planning anything:

1. **Test Synapse MCP**: Call `mcp__synapse_sql__execute_sql_read_only` with `SELECT 1 AS mcp_preflight`
2. **If it fails or the tool does not exist**: Print `BATCH ABORT: Synapse MCP unavailable` and **EXIT IMMEDIATELY**. Do NOT proceed. Do NOT fall back to "prior batch context data". Do NOT use a "schema practice" of skipping MCP. A wiki without live data sampling is INCOMPLETE and WILL NOT PASS the adversarial evaluator. STOP HERE.
3. **If it succeeds**: Print `MCP PRE-FLIGHT: PASS` and continue to Instructions.

There is NO exception to this rule. No "prior context", no "code-only documentation", no "graceful degradation". MCP down = batch aborted. Period.

---

## Instructions (regen-harness, single object)

1. **Load rules** — read these in order before anything else:
   - `.cursor/rules/semantic-layer-core/repo-first-access.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/00-execution-card.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/mcp-query-rules.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/GOLDEN-REFERENCE.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/10.5b-tier1-enforcement.mdc`

2. **Skip batch planning** — do NOT read `_index.md`, do NOT touch
   `_batch_context.json`, do NOT scan the blacklist. The harness
   already chose this object.

3. **Run the pipeline for THIS object only**: phases 1 through 11
   inclusive. Use the pre-resolved upstream bundle (provided below)
   as your authoritative Tier 1 source. Generate three files in
   `audits/regen-sample/{schema}/{object}/regen/attempt_{N}/`:
   `.lineage.md`, `.md`, `.review-needed.md`. Do NOT generate
   `.alter.sql`. Do NOT modify any file under `knowledge/synapse/Wiki/`.

4. **Skip Phase 16** — the adversarial judge runs in a separate,
   fresh claude process after you exit. Self-evaluation here wastes
   tokens and pollutes the comparison.

5. **Exit cleanly** after printing the OUTPUT CHECK block defined in
   the Regen Harness preamble.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_Position is the central trading record table in DWH, containing every position (trade) ever opened on the eToro platform. Each row represents a single trading position lifecycle: opened by a customer (CID) on an instrument (InstrumentID), held for some duration, and either still open (CloseDateID=0) or closed with a final NetProfit. The data spans positions from 2007-08-27 to the most recent load date (2026-03-10 as of last ETL run 2026-03-11).

**Position types represented**:
- **Retail positions**: Opened by customers directly in the eToro web/mobile app
- **Mirror/CopyTrading positions**: Opened when a customer copies another trader (MirrorID links to Dim_Mirror); ParentPositionID links to the "master" position
- **Copy Fund positions**: IsCopyFundPosition=1 when the position's root (TreeID) belongs to a fund account (AccountTypeID=9)
- **AirDrop positions**: IsAirDrop=1 for positions created via airdrop events (crypto)
- **ReOpen positions**: IsReOpen=1 for positions reopened after a ReOpen event; ReopenForPositionID points to the original

**Open vs Closed state**:
- Open position: CloseDateID=0, CloseOccurred='1900-01-01 00:00:00'
- Closed position: CloseDateID=YYYYMMDD (e.g., 20260310), CloseOccurred = actual close timestamp

**Data Sources (merged in ETL)**:
- Open positions: `etoro_Trade_OpenPositionEndOfDay` (today's snapshot of all open positions)
- Closed positions: `etoro_History_ClosePositionEndOfDay` (positions that closed on @dt)

**134 columns** covering financial amounts, forex rates at open/close, market prices (spread data), execution IDs, order IDs, hedge types, and fee calculations added through 2025.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Open vs Closed Position States

**What**: The same position row transitions from "open" to "closed" as its lifecycle progresses.

**Columns Involved**: `CloseDateID`, `CloseOccurred`, `NetProfit`, `EndForexRate`, `ClosePositionReasonID`

**Rules**:
- **Open state**: CloseDateID=0, CloseOccurred='1900-01-01 00:00:00.000'. NetProfit holds unrealized P&L (updated daily). EndForexRate=NULL (position not yet closed).
- **Closed state**: CloseDateID=YYYYMMDD int (e.g., 20260310), CloseOccurred=actual datetime. NetProfit holds realized P&L. ClosePositionReasonID explains why it closed.
- **ETL daily cycle**: Each day, rows for positions that opened or closed that day are deleted/updated and re-inserted fresh from staging.
- **CloseDateID=19000101** is a transient internal state used during ETL processing (positions being "reset" before re-insertion); analysts should filter `WHERE CloseDateID NOT IN (0, 19000101)` for confirmed closed positions.
- **OpenDateID and CloseDateID**: Both are YYYYMMDD integers, NOT dates. Use `CAST(CAST(OpenDateID AS VARCHAR(8)) AS DATE)` to convert.

**Diagram**:
```
Position lifecycle in Dim_Position:
  Day 1 (open):  CloseDateID=0,        CloseOccurred='1900-01-01'  <-- still open
  Day N (close): CloseDateID=YYYYMMDD, CloseOccurred=actual time   <-- closed
  During ETL:    CloseDateID=19000101  <-- transient, skip in queries
```

### 2.2 Social Trading Relationships

**What**: How copy-trading and mirror relationships are encoded.

**Columns Involved**: `MirrorID`, `ParentPositionID`, `OrigParentPositionID`, `TreeID`, `IsCopyFundPosition`

**Rules**:
- **MirrorID**: FK to Dim_Mirror. When a customer copies another trader, all positions generated share the same MirrorID.
- **ParentPositionID**: The position ID of the "master" position being copied. NULL for original/manual positions.
- **OrigParentPositionID**: The original parent (before any reopen/rebalance operations).
- **TreeID**: FK back to Dim_Position.PositionID -- points to the root position of the copy tree. Used to identify CopyFund positions.
- **IsCopyFundPosition=1**: The position belongs to a copy-fund tree (TreeID's CID has AccountTypeID=9).

### 2.3 Financial Metrics and Commissions

**What**: How P&L and commission amounts flow through a position lifecycle.

**Columns Involved**: `Amount`, `NetProfit`, `Commission`, `CommissionOnClose`, `FullCommission`, `FullCommissionOnClose`, `EndOfWeekFee`, `PnLInDollars`

**Rules**:
- **Amount**: Position notional value in USD at open.
- **NetProfit**: Realized P&L for closed positions; unrealized daily P&L for open positions (updated daily from EndOfDayPnLInDollars).
- **Commission**: Opening commission charged.
- **CommissionOnClose**: Closing commission. Set to 0 for open positions; filled when position closes.
- **FullCommission / FullCommissionOnClose**: Total commissions including all components.
- **EndOfWeekFee**: Overnight fee charged on weekends for leveraged positions. CloseOnEndOfWeek=1 means position auto-closes at weekend.
- **PnLInDollars**: Unrealized daily P&L for open positions (from EndOfDayPnLInDollars staging column); realized at close.

### 2.4 Position Segmentation and Regulation

**What**: Regulatory context and platform categorization at time of open.

**Columns Involved**: `RegulationIDOnOpen`, `PlatformTypeID`, `PositionSegment`

**Rules**:
- **RegulationIDOnOpen**: The regulatory jurisdiction (entity) the customer belonged to at the time of opening. Derived from a JOIN with etoro_History_BackOfficeCustomer at ETL time. 1=UK/FCA, 2=Cyprus/CySEC, etc.
- **PlatformTypeID**: FK to Dim_PlatformType. 1=Web, 2=iOS, 3=Android, 0=Undefined.
- **PositionSegment**: Internal segment classification (smallint).

### 2.5 Volume and Unit Calculations

**What**: ETL-computed unit and volume metrics.

**Columns Involved**: `AmountInUnitsDecimal`, `LotCountDecimal`, `Volume`, `VolumeOnClose`, `UnitMargin`, `InitialUnits`

**Rules**:
- **AmountInUnitsDecimal**: Position size in instrument units (e.g., shares, crypto coins).
- **LotCountDecimal**: Position size in lots.
- **Volume**: ETL-computed = ROUND(AmountInUnitsDecimal * InitForexRate * USD conversion factor, 0) -- approximates USD equivalent at open.
- **VolumeOnClose**: Similar calculation using EndForexRate at close.
- **UnitMargin**: Margin per unit for leveraged positions.
- **InitialUnits**: Original units before any partial-close or partial-reopen adjustments.

### 2.6 Open/Close Rates and Market Prices

**What**: The forex rates, market prices, and spread data captured at open and close.

**Columns Involved**: `InitForexRate`, `EndForexRate`, `SpreadedPipBid`, `SpreadedPipAsk`, `InitForex_Ask/Bid/AskSpreaded/BidSpreaded/USDConversionRate`, `EndForex_*`, `OpenMarket_*`, `CloseMarket_*`

**Rules**:
- **InitForexRate / EndForexRate**: The execution rate at open and close respectively (in instrument's base currency per USD or USD per instrument).
- **InitForex_* columns**: Ask, Bid, spreaded variants, and USD conversion rate at the INIT price rate ID (raw price book). Populated from PriceLog_History_CurrencyPrice_Active.
- **EndForex_***: Same price book data at the END (close) rate.
- **OpenMarket_* / CloseMarket_***: Market prices at the time of market open/close events. Added 2023-03-07 (12 columns).
- **SpreadedPipBid / SpreadedPipAsk**: Bid/ask spread in pips at execution.

### 2.7 Fees and Taxes (Post-2025)

**What**: Tax and fee components added in 2025.

**Columns Involved**: `OpenTotalTaxes`, `CloseTotalTaxes`, `OpenTotalFees`, `CloseTotalFees`, `EstimateCloseFeeForCFD`, `EstimateCloseFeeOnOpenByUnits`, `EstimateCloseFeeOnOpen`, `Close_PnLInDollars`, `Close_CalculationRate`, `Close_ConversionRate`, `Close_PriceType`, `CurrentCalculationRate`, `CurrentConversionRate`

**Rules**:
- Added 2025-06-25 (Adi Ferber) and 2025-09-08 (Daniel Kaplan).
- These columns will be NULL for positions opened/closed before the ETL addition date.
- `EstimateCloseFeeForCFD/OnOpenByUnits/OnOpen`: Fee estimates for CFD instruments at open.
- `Close_PnLInDollars / Close_CalculationRate / Close_ConversionRate / Close_PriceType`: Close-side P&L metrics with explicit calculation chain.

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Partitioning

**HASH (PositionID)**: Rows distributed by PositionID across nodes. Single-position lookups are efficient. JOINs between two HASH(PositionID) tables (e.g., Dim_Position JOIN Dim_PositionChangeLog by PositionID) are co-located and fast.

**Clustered Index (CloseDateID, PositionID)**: Clustered on close date -- date-range queries on closed positions are efficient. Open-position queries (CloseDateID=0) hit a single partition.

**Monthly partitioning**: Partitioned from 2007-01-01 to 2026-02-28 by CloseDateID. Always include a CloseDateID range filter in queries to enable partition elimination. Without it, all 230+ partitions are scanned.

**NOT ENFORCED PK**: The primary key on (PositionID, CloseDateID) is NOT ENFORCED. Synapse does not validate uniqueness. PositionID is logically unique per position, but be aware: duplicate PositionIDs can exist if ETL has a bug.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, this table lands as `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_position`. Partitioned monthly by CloseDateID. Use `WHERE CloseDateID >= 20260101` style filters for partition pruning. Z-ORDER on PositionID within each partition is beneficial for position-lookup workloads.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Get closed positions for a date range | WHERE CloseDateID BETWEEN 20260101 AND 20260310 |
| Get all open positions | WHERE CloseDateID = 0 |
| Get a customer's positions | WHERE CID = X AND CloseDateID BETWEEN ... (always include date range!) |
| P&L for closed positions | SUM(NetProfit) WHERE CloseDateID > 0 AND CloseDateID != 19000101 |
| CopyTrading positions only | WHERE MirrorID IS NOT NULL |
| Direct (non-copy) positions | WHERE MirrorID IS NULL AND ParentPositionID IS NULL |
| CopyFund positions only | WHERE IsCopyFundPosition = 1 |
| Long positions only | WHERE IsBuy = 1 |
| Short positions | WHERE IsBuy = 0 |
| By instrument | WHERE InstrumentID = X AND CloseDateID BETWEEN ... |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **NEVER query without CloseDateID filter**: Without a date range filter, Synapse scans all 230+ monthly partitions. Always include `WHERE CloseDateID BETWEEN X AND Y` or `WHERE CloseDateID = 0`.
- **CloseDateID=0 for open, CloseDateID=19000101 during ETL**: Exclude 19000101 in most queries: `WHERE CloseDateID NOT IN (0, 19000101)` for confirmed-closed positions.
- **OpenDateID and CloseDateID are int, not date**: They are in YYYYMMDD format. Use `CAST(CAST(OpenDateID AS VARCHAR(8)) AS DATE)` to convert.
- **HASH distribution on PositionID**: Very efficient for single-position or position-list queries. Less efficient for large customer-level scans (CID is not the distribution key).
- **NOT ENFORCED PK**: PositionID uniqueness is not enforced by the database. Check for duplicates if needed.
- **134 columns -- many nullable**: Most columns beyond the core set are NULL for older positions predating their addition (2022-2025). Don't assume non-null.
- **Volume = ETL-computed approximation**: Volume (int) is rounded to nearest integer. VolumeOnClose uses EndForexRate which may differ. Not always perfectly accurate.
- **UpdateDate = GETDATE() or GETUTCDATE()**: Mixed -- open positions use GETDATE(), UPDATE path for closing positions uses GETUTCDATE(). Not a reliable "modified since" field.
- **IsPartialCloseParent / IsPartialCloseChild**: 1 if this position was split via partial close. Use OriginalPositionID to trace the original. Generally filter ISNULL(IsPartialCloseChild,0)=0 on OPEN metrics only — NEVER on CLOSE. Some open metrics (e.g., volume) are already pro-rated, so excluding children would be wrong. Apply the filter case-by-case.
- **RegulationIDOnOpen is 0 for unmatched**: If the ETL JOIN with BackOfficeCustomer history finds no regulation at that date, ISNULL defaults to 0.
- **AmountInUnitsDecimal may change**: Position amount can be adjusted (e.g., partial close). Dim_PositionChangeLog tracks historical amount values.

### Upstream `BI_DB_dbo.BI_DB_PositionPnL` — synapse
- **Resolved as**: `BI_DB_dbo.BI_DB_PositionPnL`
- **Wiki path**: `C:\Users\guyman\Documents\github\Databricks_Knowledge\knowledge\synapse\Wiki\BI_DB_dbo\Tables\BI_DB_PositionPnL.md`

# BI_DB_dbo.BI_DB_PositionPnL

## 1. Overview

Daily end-of-day snapshot of **open trading positions** with unrealized P&L, rates, commissions, NOP, and close-price metrics. Grain is **one row per position per calendar day** (`DateID` + `PositionID`); only positions open as of end of `@dt` appear for that `DateID`.

## 2. Business Context

- **Rules**: Positions are sourced from `DWH_dbo.Dim_Position` with `OpenDateID < @ReportDateID` and still open on `@dt` (`CloseDateID >= @ReportDateID` or `CloseDateID = 0`). `Dim_PositionChangeLog` rewinds `Amount`, `StopRate`, `AmountInUnitsDecimal`, and `IsSettled` when changes occur after `@dt`; rows with partial-close child (`ChangeTypeID = 11`) after `@dt` are removed. Stock splits adjust `InitForexRate`, units, and EOD rates via `Dim_HistorySplitRatio` and `#Prices`. **PositionPnL** is `PnLInDollars` from Dim_Position (authoritative PnL engine) since 2024-03-24; **Price** and **NOP** still use SP formulas from EOD rates and `Dim_Instrument` FX chains. **DailyPnL** is updated after load as today `PositionPnL` minus prior day `PositionPnL` per `PositionID`.
- **Consumers**: Finance and CMR reporting; downstream BI_DB procedures and views (e.g. crypto zero / loan / NOP stacks, IFRS, compliance, dashboards) read this table as the canonical daily position P&L snapshot.

## 6. ETL & Lifecycle

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Writer** | `BI_DB_dbo.SP_PositionPnL` @dt |
| **OpsDB** | Priority **99**, ProcessType **4** (FinanceReportSPS), frequency **Daily** |
| **Pattern** | Build `#UnrealizedPnL` -- create `BI_DB_PositionPnL_SWITCH_SINGLE` with same distribution/index/partition scheme as main table -- `INSERT ... SELECT` from `#UnrealizedPnL` -- `SP_BI_DB_PositionPnL_SWITCH` partition swap -- `UPDATE` **DailyPnL** vs previous `DateID` |
| **Grain** | One row per open `PositionID` per `DateID` |
| **Delete scope** | Daily partition replaced via switch for the target `DateID` (not a full-table DELETE) |

## 7. Query Advisory

- **Partition elimination**: Always filter **`WHERE DateID = ...` or a tight `DateID` range**; scanning all daily partitions is prohibitively expensive.
- **Distribution**: **`PositionID`** is the hash key -- joins and GROUP BY on `PositionID` minimize movement; filtering large sets by `CID` alone may benefit from **`IX_BI_DB_PositionPnL_CID (DateID, CID)`** when present.
- **Semantics**: Table holds **open** positions only for each snapshot date; closed-position economics live in `Dim_Position` / fact tables.
- **DailyPnL**: Populated in a second step; for intraday copies of switch tables, expect NULL until the main-table UPDATE runs.

## 8. Classification & Status

| Field | Value |

## 1. Business Meaning

Fact_SnapshotCustomer is the central customer state table in the DWH. For every eToro customer (RealCID), it holds one row per distinct attribute state within a year, recording which attributes were active between FromDate and ToDate (encoded together in `DateRangeID`). The pattern is SCD Type 2 by year: each year's rows are closed as attribute changes occur, and a new open row is created with the updated state. At year-end, all open rows are closed and reopened with the new year's date range.

As of 2026-03-19: **406M+ total rows**, **46.4M distinct customers**, data from **2007-08-22 to present**. 302M rows are "currently open" (ToDate = year-end). 11.9% of current open rows represent depositors; 98.0% are valid customers (IsValidCustomer=1).

The SP loads data from 6 source systems via staging Ext_FSC tables pre-populated by SP_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_DL_To_Synapse. The core CC (Customer Core) source provides demographics and status; the BO (Back Office) source provides risk/compliance attributes. RegulationID is taken from RegulationChangeLog — **not** from Back Office — because regulation changes take effect end-of-day.

8 legacy columns (DemoCID, CustomerChangeTypeID, CurentValue, PreviousValue, DocsOK, Bankruptcy, PremiumAccount, Evangelist) are present in the DDL but NOT populated by the current SP. They carry DEFAULT (0) values.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 SCD Type 2 Pattern — DateRangeID

**What**: Each customer-state row has a DateRangeID encoding both the open date (FromDate) and close date (ToDate) as a 12-digit bigint.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `RealCID`

**Rules**:
- DateRangeID = `YYYYMMDD` (open date, 8 chars) + `MMDDD` (year-end month+day, 4 chars) → e.g., `202603101231` = opened 2026-03-10, closes 2026-12-31
- When an attribute changes, the SP updates DateRangeID of the existing row to close it (right 4 chars become yesterday's MMDD), then inserts a new row with today's open date + year-end
- To get the **most current row** per customer: `RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4) = '1231'`
- On January 1st: all prior year's open rows are closed (12-31) and re-opened for the new year
- The `Dim_Range` dimension table stores FromDateID + ToDateID for each DateRangeID

### 2.2 IsValidCustomer — Segment Flag

**What**: Computed flag indicating whether a customer is a "valid" retail customer for analytics (excludes demo, blocked countries, excluded labels).

**Columns Involved**: `IsValidCustomer`, `PlayerLevelID`, `LabelID`, `CountryID`

**Rules** (as of post-2020-03-14):
```
IsValidCustomer = 1 IF:
  PlayerLevelID <> 4 (not demo)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (30, 26) (not internal/excluded label)
  AND CountryID <> 250 (not blocked country)
ELSE 0
```
Pre-2020-03-14 rule additionally excluded AccountTypeID=9.

### 2.3 IsCreditReportValidCB — Credit Reporting Flag

**What**: Flag indicating whether a customer is eligible for credit report validation (CB = CreditBureau context).

**Columns Involved**: `IsCreditReportValidCB`, `PlayerLevelID`, `AccountTypeID`, `LabelID`, `CountryID`

**Rules** (as of post-2020-03-14):
```
IsCreditReportValidCB = 1 IF:
  NOT (PlayerLevelID = 4 AND AccountTypeID <> 2)  (not non-real demo)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (26, 30)
  AND NOT (CountryID = 250 AND CID NOT IN (3400616, 10526243))
ELSE 0
```

### 2.4 RegulationID — End-of-Day Rule

**What**: A customer's regulatory jurisdiction is taken from RegulationChangeLog (end-of-day change), NOT from the back-office system (immediate change), because regulation changes take effect at end of day for business/legal reasons.

**Columns Involved**: `RegulationID`, sourced from `Ext_FSC_BackOffice_RegulationChangeLog.ToRegulationID`

### 2.5 GDPR Erasure Masking

**What**: When a GDPR deletion request is processed, the UserName in Customer Core gets a `DelUserName` prefix. The SP detects this and masks Email, City, Address, Zip, and PhoneNumber in Fact_SnapshotCustomer.

**Columns Involved**: `Email`, `City`, `Address`, `Zip`, `PhoneNumber`

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, HASH(RealCID) distribution + CCI makes per-customer aggregations and filters on RealCID highly efficient — queries that filter or join on RealCID benefit from colocation. The NCI on RealCID provides efficient point-lookup for single customers.

**Warning**: With 406M rows, full table scans are expensive. Always filter by DateRangeID or a specific year range when possible.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage

**In Databricks**, the data is accessed via `V_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_FromDateID` (generic_id=1115), not directly. Two UC targets:
- `pii_data.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_v_fact_snapshotcustomer_fromdateid` — full PII (gated access)
- `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_v_fact_snapshotcustomer_fromdateid_masked` — Email/City/Address/Zip masked

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Current state for all customers | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` |
| Current state for one customer | `WHERE RealCID = @cid AND RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` |
| Customer state on a specific date | `WHERE RealCID = @cid AND LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),8) <= @date AND RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) >= RIGHT(@date, 4)` |
| Count of depositors | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231' AND IsDepositor = 1` |
| Valid retail customers | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231' AND IsValidCustomer = 1` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Country | ON f.CountryID = dc.CountryID | Country name/region |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Label | ON f.LabelID = dl.LabelID | Brand/label name |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Language | ON f.LanguageID = dl.LanguageID | Customer language |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_VerificationLevel | ON f.VerificationLevelID = dv.VerificationLevelID | KYC verification status |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_PlayerStatus | ON f.PlayerStatusID = dp.PlayerStatusID | Account lifecycle status |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Regulation | ON f.RegulationID = dr.RegulationID | Regulatory jurisdiction |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_AccountStatus | ON f.AccountStatusID = das.AccountStatusID | Account enabled/disabled |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Range | ON f.DateRangeID = dr.DateRangeID | Decode FromDateID + ToDateID |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_Guru_Copiers | ON f.RealCID = fg.RealCID | Copy-trading activity |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **DateRangeID is NOT a date** — it is a 12-digit bigint encoding (FromDate)(ToDate MMDD). Always extract with LEFT(...,8) for FromDate and RIGHT(...,4) for ToDate MMDD.
- **Most-current-row filter**: `RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` gets the currently open row, but after year-end closure this may temporarily return 0 rows. Use `MAX(DateRangeID)` per RealCID as a safer alternative.
- **Legacy columns with 0 defaults**: DemoCID, CustomerChangeTypeID, CurentValue, PreviousValue, DocsOK, Bankruptcy, PremiumAccount, Evangelist are all DEFAULT 0 and NOT populated by the current SP. Do not rely on them.
- **PII masking**: Email, City, Address, Zip are dynamically masked (`MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'default()')`). Users without `UNMASK` permission see NULL. PhoneNumber is NOT masked at DDL level but is GDPR-erased via the SP for deleted users.
- **WeekendFeePrecentage** (note: typo in column name — "Precentage" instead of "Percentage") — use as-is.
- **AccountStatusID distribution**: 1=93.2% (Active), 0=6.1% (unknown/default), 2=0.9% (Inactive). Only 3 distinct values observed.
- **Not exported directly to UC** — join via `V_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_FromDateID` in UC.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_Range is a DWH-internal helper lookup that pre-computes all possible (FromDate, ToDate) date range pairs needed by the Snapshot analytics pipelines. Each row represents a unique start-to-end date interval, identified by a composite BigInt key (DateRangeID). The table enables efficient range-based JOINs in SnapshotEquity and SnapshotCustomer views without requiring date arithmetic at query time.

This table has no external production source. It is generated entirely within the DWH by SP_Fact_SnapshotEquity and SP_Fact_SnapshotCustomer, which INSERT new DateRangeID combinations as they encounter new date pairs during snapshot processing. The pattern is append-only - new rows are added daily but existing rows are never updated or deleted.

As of 2026-03-10, the table contains approximately 1.3 million date range pairs spanning from 2007-01-01 to 2026-03-10 on the FromDate side, and 2007-08-26 to 2026-12-31 on the ToDate side.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 DateRangeID Encoding

**What**: DateRangeID is a deterministic composite key encoding both FromDate and MMDD(ToDate) into a single 12-digit BigInt.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `FromDateID`, `ToDateID`

**Rules**:
- Formula: `DateRangeID = CONCAT(YYYYMMDD(FromDate), MMDD(ToDate))`
- Example: FromDateID=20070101, ToDateID=20071231 -> DateRangeID=200701011231
- Decoding FromDateID: `CONVERT(INT, LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 8))`
- Decoding ToDateID: `CONVERT(INT, LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4) + RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4))`
- The YEAR component of ToDateID is always the SAME as the YEAR of FromDateID (only MMDD of ToDate is stored in the last 4 digits)

**Diagram**:
```
DateRangeID (12-digit BigInt):
  [ YYYY | MM | DD | MM | DD ]
  [  From Year  | From MMDD  | To MMDD ]
   |___________|             |________|
   Chars 1-8 = FromDateID    Chars 9-12 = MMDD(ToDate)

  ToDateID = YYYY(FromDate) + MMDD(ToDate)
  -> Year-end range example:
     FromDate=2020-03-15, ToDate=2020-12-31
     DateRangeID = 202003151231
     ToDateID    = 20201231
```

### 2.2 Snapshot Range Pattern

**What**: Dim_Range is the bridge between individual customer dates and fiscal/calendar year-end periods in Snapshot reports.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `FromDateID`, `ToDateID`

**Rules**:
- The primary use case is "from customer registration/event date to year-end": FromDate = customer's start date, ToDate = December 31 of that year
- The SPs also generate non-year-end ranges when snapshots require partial-period measurements
- The table grows daily as new snapshot dates are processed
- No deduplication needed - DateRangeID uniqueness is enforced by the NOT EXISTS check in both SPs

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with a composite CLUSTERED INDEX on (DateRangeID, FromDateID, ToDateID) and three Non-Clustered Indexes: IX_Dim_Range_FromDateID, IX_Dim_Range_ToDateID, and IX_Dim_Range_FromDateID_ToDateID. The NCI indexes are unusual for Synapse (which typically uses only CCI) and suggest heavy range-based lookups by the Snapshot SPs. Always filter on FromDateID or ToDateID directly to leverage these indexes.

Note: PRIMARY KEY (DateRangeID) is declared NOT ENFORCED - Synapse does not validate uniqueness but the ETL SPs maintain it via NOT EXISTS guards.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, the Gold export at `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_range` is Parquet. With 1.3M rows, consider filtering on FromDateID for performance.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Find the DateRangeID for a specific (from, to) pair | `SELECT DateRangeID FROM DWH_dbo.Dim_Range WHERE FromDateID = @from AND ToDateID = @to` |
| Find all ranges starting from a given date | `WHERE FromDateID = @date` (uses IX_Dim_Range_FromDateID) |
| Look up range details from a DateRangeID | `SELECT FromDateID, ToDateID FROM DWH_dbo.Dim_Range WHERE DateRangeID = @id` |
| Check how many ranges exist for a year | `WHERE FromDateID BETWEEN @year*10000+101 AND @year*10000+1231` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotEquity | DateRangeID | Resolve snapshot equity date ranges |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer | DateRangeID | Resolve snapshot customer date ranges |
| DWH_dbo.V_Fact_SnapshotEquity | DateRangeID | View-level access to snapshot equity with resolved ranges |
| DWH_dbo.V_M2M_Date_DateRange | DateRangeID | Month-to-month date range bridging |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **ToDate YEAR = FromDate YEAR**: The DateRangeID encoding only stores MMDD of ToDate. The year of ToDate is derived from FromDate's year. This means all ranges in this table are within-year ranges - cross-year ranges cannot be represented.
- **INSERT-only, no TRUNCATE**: Both writer SPs use NOT EXISTS guards, making the table append-only. Rows are never deleted. If a DateRangeID is erroneously created, it persists forever.
- **Primary key NOT ENFORCED**: Synapse does not verify uniqueness of DateRangeID. Trust the ETL logic, not the constraint.
- **DateRangeID is a STRING-derived number**: Always treat DateRangeID as a derived key, not a business ID. Decode using LEFT/RIGHT string operations if needed.
- **1.3M rows for a dim table**: Larger than typical dimensions. REPLICATE is appropriate given daily Snapshot SP joins from all distributions.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_Instrument is the master instrument dimension for the DWH, containing 15,707 rows representing every tradeable instrument on the eToro platform. It covers Stocks (12,849), ETFs (1,287), Crypto Currencies (667), Commodities (503), Indices (247), and Currencies/Forex (153), plus one sentinel row (InstrumentID=0, 'NA').

The table is populated by `DWH_dbo.SP_Dim_Instrument`, which performs a full truncate-and-reload on each run. The SP joins the staging replica of the production `Trade.GetInstrument` view with `Dictionary.Currency` (for buy/sell abbreviations), `Trade.InstrumentMetaData` (display names, symbols, exchange, ISIN, industry), `Trade.ProviderToInstrument` (precision, allow flags, bonus credit, provider margin), `Trade.InstrumentCusip` (CUSIP identifiers), `Trade.FuturesMetaData` (multiplier, settlement time), `Trade.FuturesInstrumentsInitialMarginByProviderMapping` (provider margin per lot), and `Trade.Instrument` (OperationMode).

After the initial INSERT, the SP performs post-insert UPDATEs to enrich rows with: ReceivedOnPriceServer (from PriceLog history), AssetClass/IndustryGroup (from a static classification table), ADV_Last3Months/MKTcap/SharesOutStanding (from Rankings.StockInfo.InstrumentData), and PlatformSector/PlatformIndustry (from Rankings platform metadata). Finally, a sentinel row (InstrumentID=0) is inserted with 'NA' placeholder values, and `SP_Dim_Instrument_Snapshot` is called for date-partitioned snapshots.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 InstrumentType CASE Mapping

**What**: Translates numeric InstrumentTypeID into human-readable asset class labels.

**Columns Involved**: `InstrumentTypeID`, `InstrumentType`

**Rules**:
- 1 = Currencies (153 instruments)
- 2 = Commodities (503)
- 4 = Indices (247)
- 5 = Stocks (12,849)
- 6 = ETF (1,287)
- 10 = Crypto Currencies (667)
- All others = Other

### 2.2 IsMajor Flag Mapping

**What**: Converts the production bit flag IsMajor (0/1) into a Yes/No string.

**Columns Involved**: `IsMajorID`, `IsMajor`

**Rules**:
- IsMajorID stores the raw bit value from Trade.GetInstrument.IsMajor
- IsMajor = 'Yes' when IsMajorID = 1, 'No' otherwise
- Yes: 6,963 instruments; No: 8,743; NA: 1 (sentinel)

### 2.3 IsFuture Derivation from InstrumentGroups

**What**: Determines whether an instrument is a futures contract based on membership in GroupID=25 in Trade.InstrumentGroups.

**Columns Involved**: `IsFuture`

**Rules**:
- 1 if InstrumentID exists in Trade.InstrumentGroups WHERE GroupID=25
- 0 otherwise
- 243 instruments flagged as futures; 15,463 non-futures

### 2.4 Post-Insert Market Data Enrichment

**What**: After the main INSERT, the SP updates financial metrics from Rankings.StockInfo data.

**Columns Involved**: `ADV_Last3Months`, `MKTcap`, `SharesOutStanding`, `PlatformSector`, `PlatformIndustry`

**Rules**:
- ADV_Last3Months from MetadataID=8557 (KeyName='AverageDailyVolumeLast3Months-TTM')
- MKTcap = ISNULL(MarketCapitalization-TTM, CryptoMarketCap) — falls back to crypto market cap
- SharesOutStanding from MetadataID=8444 (KeyName='SharesOutstandingCurrent-Annual')
- PlatformSector from MetadataID=8436 (StrVal, pivoted)
- PlatformIndustry from MetadataID=8280 (StrVal, pivoted)

### 2.5 Sentinel Row

**What**: A placeholder row with InstrumentID=0 is inserted at the end of the SP for FK safety.

**Columns Involved**: All

**Rules**:
- InstrumentID=0, InstrumentTypeID=0, InstrumentType='NA', Name='NA'
- Most nullable columns set to NULL
- StatusID=NULL (vs 1 for data rows)

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

REPLICATE distribution means the full table is copied to every compute node — ideal for a 15K-row dimension used in JOINs with large fact tables. CLUSTERED INDEX on InstrumentID supports point lookups and range scans. No distribution key to worry about for colocation.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Look up an instrument by ID | `WHERE InstrumentID = @id` — clustered index seek |
| Filter by asset class | `WHERE InstrumentType = 'Stocks'` or `WHERE InstrumentTypeID = 5` |
| Find tradeable instruments | `WHERE Tradable = 1` |
| Futures only | `WHERE IsFuture = 1` |
| Search by symbol | `WHERE Symbol = 'AAPL'` or `WHERE SymbolFull = 'AAPL'` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Fact tables (positions, orders) | `ON f.InstrumentID = di.InstrumentID` | Resolve instrument name, type, exchange |
| Dim_Customer | Via fact table bridge | Instrument exposure per customer |
| Fact_CurrencyPriceWithSplit | `ON f.InstrumentID = di.InstrumentID` | Price data with instrument metadata |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **InstrumentID=0 is a sentinel** — exclude it with `WHERE InstrumentID > 0` in aggregations
- **IsMajor is a varchar 'Yes'/'No'**, not a bit — use IsMajorID (int) for numeric filters
- **InstrumentType 'NA'** only appears on the sentinel row
- **Multiplier is NULL** for 15,464 of 15,707 rows — only populated for futures instruments
- **AssetClass is NULL** for 13,557 rows — only populated from the static classification table
- **OperationMode is NULL** for sentinel row only; 0=Standard (13,140), 1=Alternate (2,566, primarily European stock CFDs)

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_Regulation defines the 15 regulatory jurisdictions under which eToro operates globally. Each regulation represents a financial authority (CySEC, FCA, ASIC, FinCEN, etc.) and maps to an eToro legal entity holding the corresponding license. This classification drives multi-jurisdiction compliance - it determines which rules apply to each customer, what instruments they can trade, what leverage limits are enforced, and how their funds are segregated. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, Dictionary.Regulation)

RegulationID is one of the most frequently joined columns in the DWH. It is assigned to users at registration (CustomerStatic.RegulationID) and propagated through every subsequent operation - deposits, trading, copy-trading, and compliance reporting. V_Dim_Customer joins Dim_Regulation to resolve the regulation name for every customer.

**DWH vs Production differences**: The DWH strips 6 columns from production (IsUSA, JurisdictionName, BankID, RegulationLongName, RegulationShortName, DefaultRegulationID) and adds 3 DWH-specific columns (DWHRegulationID = ID alias, StatusID = hardcoded 1, ClusterRegulationID = grouping logic). Analysts needing US/non-US split or jurisdiction names should reference the upstream wiki or query production via the Bronze layer.

Loaded daily by SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse via TRUNCATE+INSERT from DWH_staging.etoro_Dictionary_Regulation. All 15 rows have StatusID=1 (Active). No sentinel row.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 ClusterRegulationID Grouping

**What**: The ETL groups certain regulations into a single cluster (ID=1) for analytics aggregation.

**Columns Involved**: `ClusterRegulationID`, `ID`

**Rules**:
- IDs 0 (None), 1 (CySEC), 5 (BVI) -> ClusterRegulationID=1 (grouped as "CySEC/BVI/None" cluster)
- All other IDs -> ClusterRegulationID = ID (each regulation is its own cluster)

**Rationale**: BVI (5) is the non-US fallback regulation for users in jurisdictions without a specific eToro entity. CySEC (1) is the primary EU regulation. None (0) is the sentinel for unassigned users. Grouping them under cluster 1 allows DWH analytics to treat these three as a single reporting unit.

```
ClusterRegulationID mapping:
  ID=0 (None)    -> Cluster 1
  ID=1 (CySEC)   -> Cluster 1
  ID=5 (BVI)     -> Cluster 1
  All others     -> Cluster = ID (FCA=2, NFA=3, ASIC=4, eToroUS=6, ...)
```

### 2.2 DWH Column Gaps vs Production

**What**: The DWH drops 6 production columns that are needed for full compliance analysis.

**Columns Dropped**:
- `IsUSA` - US/non-US jurisdiction flag (critical for instrument availability branching)
- `JurisdictionName` - eToro legal entity name (e.g., "eToro EU", "eToro UK")
- `BankID` - FK to Dictionary.Bank (custodian banking partner)
- `RegulationLongName` - Full formal name (e.g., "Cyprus Securities Exchange Commission")
- `RegulationShortName` - Abbreviated code for compact display
- `DefaultRegulationID` - Self-reference fallback (non-US->BVI, US->eToroUS)

**Impact**: DWH analytics that need US vs non-US split must either hardcode the IDs (6, 7, 8, 12, 14 are US) or join to the Bronze layer. See Section 3.4 Gotchas.

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with CLUSTERED INDEX on ID. With 15 rows, REPLICATE is optimal. Join on ID directly.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, the Gold export at `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_regulation` is Parquet. Read the entire table for any lookup.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resolve RegulationID to name in customer data | `LEFT JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_Regulation r ON r.ID = cs.RegulationID` |
| Group analytics by regulation cluster | `GROUP BY r.ClusterRegulationID` |
| US vs non-US split (without IsUSA) | `WHERE r.ID IN (6, 7, 8, 12, 14)` for US; else non-US |
| Full customer record with regulation | Use `DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer` (pre-joins Dim_Regulation) |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.CustomerStatic / V_Dim_Customer | ON r.ID = cs.RegulationID | Resolve regulation name per customer |
| DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer | Dim_Regulation already joined (INNER JOIN on RegulationID) | Use view instead of re-joining |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **IsUSA not in DWH**: Production Dictionary.Regulation.IsUSA (US=1, non-US=0) is dropped by ETL. DWH analysts must hardcode: US regulations = IDs 6, 7, 8, 12, 14.
- **DWHRegulationID = ID**: These two columns always have the same value. DWHRegulationID is an ETL alias and appears redundant. Prefer ID for joins.
- **StatusID always 1**: Hardcoded Active for all rows. Not a meaningful filter.
- **Cluster 1 includes 3 regulations**: ClusterRegulationID=1 covers None (0), CySEC (1), and BVI (5). Aggregating by ClusterRegulationID will merge these three.
- **V_Dim_Customer uses INNER JOIN**: V_Dim_Customer has `INNER JOIN Dim_Regulation ON ID = RegulationID`. Customers with NULL RegulationID would be excluded.
- **Production has 6 more columns**: If you need IsUSA, JurisdictionName, or DefaultRegulationID, use the Bronze/staging layer or etoro.Dictionary.Regulation directly.

## 1. Business Meaning

`Dim_Country` is one of the most heavily-referenced dimension tables in the DWH. It defines every country and territory the eToro platform recognizes (251 rows: 250 active countries + 1 "Not available" placeholder at CountryID=0). Each row provides geographic classification, regulatory risk attributes, marketing segmentation, and compliance data for users registered from that country.

When a customer registers, their CountryID determines: which regulatory entity governs them (via RegulationID), what AML/KYC scrutiny level applies (IsHighRiskCountry, RiskGroupID), what marketing desk handles them (Desk), and whether they can receive RAF bonuses (IsEligibleForRAFBonusCountry).

The ETL is multi-step: TRUNCATE+INSERT from etoro.Dictionary.Country (primary, joined to etoro.Dictionary.MarketingRegion for the Region label), then three UPDATE passes that patch in EU classification from Ext_Dim_Country, Desk/CFKey from Ext_Dim_Country_Region_Desk, and RegulationID from ComplianceStateDB.Compliance.RegulationCountry. Several columns present in the upstream Dictionary.Country source are dropped in DWH (IsSettlementRestricted, DefaultCurrencyID, LanguageID, IsActive, PhonePrefix, IsoCode).

Upstream wiki: `DB_Schema/etoro/Wiki/Dictionary/Tables/Dictionary.Country.md` (quality 9.4/10, VERIFIED confidence).

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 High-Risk Country Flag (Computed)

**What**: IsHighRiskCountry is derived from RiskGroupID in the ETL, not passed through from source. AML-flagged countries trigger enhanced due diligence.

**Columns Involved**: `IsHighRiskCountry`, `RiskGroupID`

**Rules**:
- `CASE WHEN RiskGroupID IN (0, 4) THEN 0 ELSE 1 END` -> IsHighRiskCountry
- RiskGroupID=0 (None): 70 countries -> not high risk
- RiskGroupID=4 (Verified before deposit): 2 countries -> not high risk
- RiskGroupID=1 (High risk country): 100 countries -> high risk
- RiskGroupID=2 (High risk for new clients): 71 countries -> high risk
- RiskGroupID=3 (High risk FATF country): 8 countries -> high risk
- High-risk countries trigger enhanced document verification, manual review of first deposit, and reduced transaction monitoring thresholds

**Diagram**:
```
RiskGroupID -> IsHighRiskCountry
0 (None)                  -> 0  (70 countries)
4 (Verified bfr deposit)  -> 0  (2 countries)
1 (High risk)             -> 1  (100 countries)
2 (High risk new clients) -> 1  (71 countries)
3 (High risk FATF)        -> 1  (8 countries)
```

### 2.2 EU vs. European Country Classification

**What**: Two separate flags distinguish full EU membership from broader European geography.

**Columns Involved**: `EU`, `IsEuropeanCountry`

**Rules**:
- EU=1: 27 countries with full EU membership (legal/treaty member states)
- IsEuropeanCountry=1: 66 countries total (27 EU members + 39 other European countries)
- Source: Ext_Dim_Country (manual extension table), not from etoro.Dictionary.Country
- EU=1 always implies IsEuropeanCountry=1. IsEuropeanCountry=1 does NOT imply EU=1.

### 2.3 Region vs. MarketingRegion

**What**: DWH exposes two separate geographic segmentations. `Region` is marketing-driven; the source geographic `RegionID` is dropped.

**Columns Involved**: `Region`, `MarketingRegionID`, `MarketingRegionManualName`, `Desk`

**Rules**:
- `Region` is loaded from etoro.Dictionary.MarketingRegion.Name (y.Name AS Region in SP). It is the marketing region label.
- `MarketingRegionManualName` is a manual override from Ext_Dim_Country - may differ from Region (e.g., Albania: Region=ROE, MarketingRegionManualName=CEE).
- `Desk` is a sales/support desk assignment from Ext_Dim_Country_Region_Desk, joined via MarketingRegionID.
- The upstream Dictionary.Country source has a geographic `RegionID` pointing to Dictionary.Region - this is NOT loaded to DWH.
- 22 distinct Region values in DWH (South & Central America=40, Africa=38, ROW=38, French=23, etc.)

### 2.4 Dropped Source Columns (Compliance-Critical)

**What**: Several compliance and localization columns present in the upstream source are NOT loaded to DWH.

**Dropped from etoro.Dictionary.Country**:
- `IsSettlementRestricted`: 21 countries restricted to CFD-only trading (cannot hold REAL assets). Includes United States (SEC/FINRA). CRITICAL for compliance analysts.
- `DefaultCurrencyID`: Trading account default currency (USD/EUR/GBP/AUD/CAD/PLN).
- `LanguageID`: UI language default.
- `IsActive`: Whether country is active on platform.
- `PhonePrefix`: International dialing code.
- `IsoCode`: ISO 3166-1 numeric code.
- `RegionID`: Geographic region FK (DWH replaces with text Region label from MarketingRegion).

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE (correct for a 251-row dimension - broadcast to all nodes avoids data movement on JOINs). HEAP means no sorted index. The non-clustered PK on CountryID is NOT ENFORCED - duplicates are theoretically possible but prevented by ETL TRUNCATE.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, store as Delta (MANAGED), no partitioning needed (251 rows). Z-ORDER on CountryID optional for join optimization.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Decode country for a customer | `JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_Country d ON f.CountryID = d.CountryID` |
| Filter high-risk countries | `WHERE d.IsHighRiskCountry = 1` |
| Filter EU customers | `WHERE d.EU = 1` |
| Group by marketing region | `GROUP BY d.Region` |
| Find regulation for a country | `SELECT RegulationID FROM Dim_Country WHERE CountryID = @id` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON c.CountryID = d.CountryID | Decode customer country attributes |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_BillingDeposit | ON f.CountryID = d.CountryID | Country-level deposit analytics |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_CountryBin | ON c.CountryID = d.CountryID | BIN-to-country card mapping |
| DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer | ON v.CountryID = d.CountryID | Customer view with country decode |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- CountryID=0 ("Not available") is a real row - use `WHERE CountryID > 0` to exclude the placeholder in population-level queries.
- `IsHighRiskCountry` is RECOMPUTED from `RiskGroupID` by the ETL (not passthrough from source). If source IsHighRiskCountry changes but RiskGroupID stays the same, DWH will not reflect the change.
- `IsSettlementRestricted` is NOT in DWH. This critical compliance flag must be looked up in the source etoro.Dictionary.Country if needed.
- `Region` reflects `MarketingRegion.Name`, not the geographic `Dictionary.Region`. The two segmentations differ (e.g., Albania: geographic region=Europe, marketing Region=ROE).
- `DWHCountryID` always equals `CountryID` (redundant copy from SP: `x.CountryID AS DWHCountryID`). Never use both in GROUP BY.
- `StatusID` is hardcoded to 1 for all rows (including CountryID=0). No meaningful variation.
- `InsertDate` and `UpdateDate` are both set to GETDATE() on each daily reload - they reflect ETL run time, not original insert or data change time.

| 16 | RiskGroupID | int | YES | Granular country risk classification. 0=None, 1=High risk country, 2=High risk for new clients, 3=High risk FATF country, 4=Verified before deposit. More nuanced than binary IsHighRiskCountry. IsHighRiskCountry is derived from this column. (Tier 1 - Dictionary.Country upstream wiki) |
| 17 | IsEligibleForRAFBonusCountry | int | YES | Whether users from this country can participate in the Refer-A-Friend bonus program. Source: CAST(etoro.Dictionary.Country.IsEligibleForRAFBonusCountry AS int) - type cast from bit to int. 1=eligible (most countries), 0=ineligible (regulatory/fraud restrictions). (Tier 1 - Dictionary.Country upstream wiki) |

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_PlayerLevel defines the eToro Club loyalty program tiers that segment customers by their realized equity (account value). Each tier grants progressively better benefits: faster cashout processing, higher service priority, and dedicated account management. The tiers in ascending rank are: Bronze -> Silver -> Gold -> Platinum -> Platinum Plus -> Diamond, plus a special Internal tier for employee/test accounts.

The data originates from `etoro.Dictionary.PlayerLevel` on the etoroDB-REAL production SQL Server. The Generic Pipeline exports this table daily (Override strategy) to `Bronze/etoro/Dictionary/PlayerLevel/` in the data lake. Production has 7 active tier rows (IDs 1-7); DWH adds a synthetic ID=0 N/A placeholder.

**CRITICAL SCHEMA DRIFT**: The DWH ETL loads only 8 of the production's 13 columns. The following production columns are DROPPED and not available in DWH: `RealizedEquityFrom`, `RealizedEquityTo` (the primary tier qualification thresholds), `IsWalletRedeemAllowed`, `ThresholdPercentToCurrentLevel`, and `DaysInRiskBeforeDowngrade`. For tier qualification logic, query the upstream `etoro.Dictionary.PlayerLevel` directly or the upstream wiki. The DWH table is suitable only for resolving tier names and cashout hours -- not for equity-based tier evaluation.

Loaded by `SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse` via TRUNCATE + INSERT from staging, followed by a separate INSERT VALUES for the ID=0 N/A sentinel using `@ddate` (midnight timestamp). Refreshes daily.

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Tier Hierarchy and Rank Order

**What**: Six customer-facing loyalty tiers plus one internal tier, ranked by realized equity.

**Columns Involved**: `PlayerLevelID`, `Name`, `Sort`

**Rules**:
- IDs are NOT in rank order -- use `Sort` column for display ordering.
- Sort order: 0=Internal (excluded), 1=Bronze, 2=Silver, 3=Gold, 4=Platinum, 5=Platinum Plus, 6=Diamond.
- Internal (ID=4) is excluded from customer-facing reports: `WHERE PlayerLevelID <> 4`.
- ID=0 (N/A) is a DWH-only ETL placeholder for NULL FK safety. Not in production.

**Diagram**:
```
Tier Hierarchy (by Sort/Rank):
  Sort 1 = Bronze     (ID=1) -- entry level
  Sort 2 = Silver     (ID=5)
  Sort 3 = Gold       (ID=3)
  Sort 4 = Platinum   (ID=2)
  Sort 5 = Platinum + (ID=6)
  Sort 6 = Diamond    (ID=7) -- top tier
  Sort 0 = Internal   (ID=4) -- excluded
  (ID=0  = N/A       -- DWH ETL placeholder)
```

### 2.2 Cashout Processing Speed by Tier

**What**: Higher tiers receive priority cashout processing as a loyalty benefit.

**Columns Involved**: `CashoutPendingHours`

**Rules**:
- **120 hours (5 days)**: Bronze (1), Silver (5), Internal (4), N/A (0)
- **72 hours (3 days)**: Gold (3)
- **24 hours (1 day)**: Platinum (2), Platinum Plus (6), Diamond (7)
- This is one of the most impactful benefits of upper tier membership.

### 2.3 Legacy Lot/Deposit Thresholds (Deprecated)

**What**: Historical tier qualification fields -- superseded by RealizedEquity (not in DWH).

**Columns Involved**: `FromSumLotCount`, `ToSumLotCount`, `FromSumDeposit`, `ToSumDeposit`

**Rules**:
- All set to `-1` for Platinum (2), Platinum Plus (6), Diamond (7) -- meaning "disabled/not applicable".
- Bronze (1) has 1-3000 lots, $0-$999 deposit; Silver (5) has 3001-20000 lots, $1000-$4999; Gold (3) has 20001-100000 lots, $5000-$19999.
- These columns are legacy artifacts. The current tier system uses `RealizedEquityFrom/To` which are NOT loaded into DWH.
- Value -1 = "threshold disabled -- upper tier, equity-based qualification only".

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with a HEAP index. HEAP (no clustering) is unusual for dimension tables -- most Dim_ tables use CLUSTERED INDEX. With only 8 rows, HEAP is not a concern for performance but means scans are unordered. Always use `ORDER BY Sort` for consistent tier display.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, this table lands as `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_playerlevel`. With 8 rows, no partitioning or Z-ORDER is needed.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| What tier is a customer in? | JOIN Dim_Customer ON PlayerLevelID for Name |
| Tier distribution of customer base | GROUP BY PlayerLevelID, exclude Internal (ID=4) |
| Display tiers in rank order | ORDER BY Sort ASC, exclude ID=0 and ID=4 |
| Cashout processing time for a tier | SELECT CashoutPendingHours WHERE PlayerLevelID = X |
| What are the equity thresholds? | NOT available in DWH -- use upstream wiki or prod data |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON dc.PlayerLevelID = dpl.PlayerLevelID | Resolve tier name per customer |
| DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer | ON vdc.PlayerLevelID = dpl.PlayerLevelID | View-level tier resolution |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer | ON fsc.PlayerLevelID = dpl.PlayerLevelID | Tier in daily snapshots |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **IDs are NOT in rank order**: PlayerLevelID 2=Platinum, 3=Gold, 5=Silver. Always use `Sort` for ordering tiers. Filtering `PlayerLevelID > 3` does NOT mean "higher than Gold".
- **Internal tier (ID=4)**: Must be excluded in most customer analytics: `WHERE PlayerLevelID <> 4` or `WHERE PlayerLevelID NOT IN (0, 4)`.
- **-1 in range columns means disabled**: For Platinum/Platinum Plus/Diamond, FromSumLotCount=-1 and ToSumLotCount=-1 indicate the legacy lot-count threshold is not used. Do NOT interpret -1 as a valid lot count.
- **Critical columns missing from DWH**: `RealizedEquityFrom`, `RealizedEquityTo`, `DaysInRiskBeforeDowngrade`, `ThresholdPercentToCurrentLevel`, and `IsWalletRedeemAllowed` are ALL in production but NOT in DWH. For equity-tier evaluation, use the upstream source.
- **HEAP index**: Unlike most DWH Dim_ tables, this uses HEAP (no CCI). Row order is not guaranteed without explicit ORDER BY.
- **ID=0 midnight timestamp**: The N/A placeholder (ID=0) has midnight InsertDate/UpdateDate from `@ddate = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)`, while production rows have full timestamps from GETDATE().

## 1. Business Meaning

`Dim_GuruStatus` is a 9-row dictionary classifying eToro customers in the **Popular Investor (PI) program** (internally called "Guru"). The PI program allows experienced traders to earn income by being copied; status reflects their tier and program standing.

The status ladder (active tiers):
- 0 = No: Customer is not enrolled in the Popular Investor program
- 1 = Certified: Entry-level PI certification
- 2 = Cadet: First active tier of the PI program
- 3 = Rising Star: Second tier - growing following
- 4 = Champion: Third tier
- 5 = Elite: Fourth tier - top performers
- 6 = Elite Pro: Highest active tier - professional Popular Investors

Negative states:
- 7 = Removed: Previously enrolled, now removed from the program
- 8 = Rejected: Applied but rejected from the program

**GuruStatusID=0 (No)** serves as both the "not enrolled" value and the null-safe join sentinel: SP_Dim_Customer uses `ISNULL(GuruStatusID, 0)` to coerce NULLs to 0.

The data originates from `etoro.Dictionary.GuruStatus` via `DWH_staging.etoro_Dictionary_GuruStatus`. ETL: TRUNCATE + INSERT, `Name` renamed to `GuruStatusName`.

Consumers: `Dim_Customer` (each customer's current PI status), `Fact_SnapshotCustomer` (daily PI status snapshot), `Fact_CustomerAction_DL_To_Synapse` (PI status at action time).

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Popular Investor Tier Ladder

**What**: Active PI statuses represent a progression from entry-level to elite.

**Columns Involved**: `GuruStatusID`, `GuruStatusName`

**Rules**:
```
Tier progression (active):
  No (0) -> Certified (1) -> Cadet (2) -> Rising Star (3)
         -> Champion (4) -> Elite (5) -> Elite Pro (6)

Negative states (off-ladder):
  Removed (7): was in program, exited
  Rejected (8): applied, not accepted
```

**For analysis**: GuruStatusID > 0 AND < 7 = currently active in PI program. GuruStatusID = 0 = regular customer.

### 2.2 Null-Sentinel Pattern

**What**: GuruStatusID=0 (No) absorbs NULL values from Dim_Customer.

**Columns Involved**: `GuruStatusID`

**Rules**:
- SP_Dim_Customer: `ISNULL(GuruStatusID, 0) AS GuruStatusID` (customers with no PI enrollment get ID 0)
- SP_Dim_Customer change detection: `OR ISNULL(dc.GuruStatusID, 0) <> ISNULL(a.GuruStatusID, 0)`
- Meaning: NULL and 0 are semantically equivalent (not in PI program)

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, REPLICATE-distributed (9 rows - appropriate). CLUSTERED INDEX on GuruStatusID. No data movement on joins.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, 9 rows - no partitioning needed. Broadcast join automatic.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Decode GuruStatusID to name | `LEFT JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_GuruStatus ON GuruStatusID` |
| Find active Popular Investors | `WHERE GuruStatusID BETWEEN 1 AND 6` |
| Exclude regular customers | `WHERE GuruStatusID > 0 AND GuruStatusID < 7` |
| Count customers by PI tier | `GROUP BY GuruStatusName ORDER BY GuruStatusID` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON GuruStatusID | Customer's current Popular Investor status |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer | ON GuruStatusID | Daily PI status snapshot per customer |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_CustomerAction | ON GuruStatusID | PI status at time of action |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **ID=0 is NOT null**: GuruStatusID=0 means "No" (not in PI program). It is the semantic null sentinel. Do not filter it out when showing all customers - it represents the majority.
- **Active PI filter**: To find active Popular Investors, use `GuruStatusID BETWEEN 1 AND 6`. IDs 7 (Removed) and 8 (Rejected) are ex-PI or rejected applicants and should be excluded from "active PI" counts.
- **Tiers imply rank**: GuruStatusID 1-6 form a meaningful rank ordering (lower = less established). Use ORDER BY GuruStatusID for tier comparisons.

# JUDGE FEEDBACK FROM PREVIOUS ATTEMPT — apply ALL of these

Previous attempt scored **6.7** (FAIL). The adversarial judge required regeneration with the following specific fixes:

> Re-run with: (1) Re-tag MifID as (Tier 1 — DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer) and quote verbatim: 'MiFID II client categorization (Retail/Professional/Eligible Counterparty). DEFAULT 0. Source: Ext_FSC_BackOffice_Customer.MifidCategorizationID (BO). FK to Dim_MifidCategorization.' Add SP rename note. (2) Re-tag IsValidCustomer as (Tier 1 — DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer) using verbatim FSC description; retain the always-0 table-specific note. (3) Re-tag IsCreditReportValidCB as (Tier 1 — DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer) using verbatim FSC description. (4) Add UC Target to the property table — check sister table BI_DB_DailyZero_TreeSize_NEW for the target path pattern. (5) Add gotcha in Section 3.4: 'Sparse 2025 data — only ~20K rows exist for 2025 vs ~6.15M for 2021–2024. Possible ETL gap or table deprecation. Verify SP is still running before using for 2025 analysis.'

Top issues from the judge:
1. [high] `MifID` — Tagged (Tier 2 — SP_Fact_SnapshotCustomer) but b.MifidCategorizationID AS MifID is a direct rename from Fact_SnapshotCustomer whose wiki is in the bundle. Must be Tier 1 from Fact_SnapshotCustomer. Description drops 'DEFAULT 0' and 'FK to Dim_MifidCategorization'.
2. [high] `IsValidCustomer` — Tagged (Tier 2 — SP_Fact_SnapshotCustomer) but b.IsValidCustomer is a direct passthrough from Fact_SnapshotCustomer (upstream wiki available). Should be Tier 1 from Fact_SnapshotCustomer. 'Approx 98% of current rows = 1' distribution stat dropped.
3. [high] `IsCreditReportValidCB` — Tagged (Tier 2 — SP_Fact_SnapshotCustomer) but b.IsCreditReportValidCB is a direct passthrough from Fact_SnapshotCustomer (upstream wiki available). Should be Tier 1 from Fact_SnapshotCustomer.
4. [medium] `## 2. Properties table` — UC Target row is absent from the property table. The Completeness checklist requires Production Source, Refresh, Distribution, and UC Target. Only the first three are present.
5. [medium] `## 1. Business Meaning / ## 3.4 Gotchas` — Sparse 2025 data (~20K rows vs ~6.15M in 2021-2024) is documented in the review-needed sidecar but not surfaced in Section 1 or Section 3.4. Analysts using this table for 2025 analysis will encounter unexpected empty results with no warning.

Tier 1 paraphrasing failures (must be fixed verbatim):

- **MifID**:
  - Upstream: `MiFID II client categorization (Retail/Professional/Eligible Counterparty). DEFAULT 0. Source: Ext_FSC_BackOffice_Customer.MifidCategorizationID (BO). FK to Dim_MifidCategorization.`
  - You wrote: `MiFID II client categorization (Retail/Professional/Eligible Counterparty) from Fact_SnapshotCustomer.MifidCategorizationID. Renamed in SP.`
  - Loss: Missed inheritance: should be Tier 1 from Fact_SnapshotCustomer. 'DEFAULT 0' and 'FK to Dim_MifidCategorization' dropped. Tagged Tier 2 instead of Tier 1.
- **IsValidCustomer**:
  - Upstream: `1 if the customer is a valid retail customer for analytics purposes. ETL-computed from PlayerLevelID, LabelID, CountryID. See §2.2. Approx 98% of current rows = 1.`
  - You wrote: `Always 0 in this table (SP filters WHERE IsValidCustomer=0). 1 if the customer is a valid retail customer for analytics purposes. ETL-computed from PlayerLevelID, LabelID, CountryID.`
  - Loss: Missed inheritance: should be Tier 1 from Fact_SnapshotCustomer. 'Approx 98% of current rows = 1' dropped. Tagged Tier 2 instead of Tier 1.
- **IsCreditReportValidCB**:
  - Upstream: `1 if customer is eligible for CreditBureau credit report validation. ETL-computed. See §2.3.`
  - You wrote: `1 if customer is eligible for CreditBureau credit report validation. ETL-computed. Passthrough from Fact_SnapshotCustomer.`
  - Loss: Missed inheritance: should be Tier 1 from Fact_SnapshotCustomer. Tagged Tier 2 instead of Tier 1. §2.3 detail reference dropped.

Address every issue above. Do NOT regenerate the whole wiki from scratch — keep what was correct, only fix what the judge flagged.
