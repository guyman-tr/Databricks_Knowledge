# Regen Harness — Writer Prompt

# Regen Harness — Writer (single-object mode)

You are running the DWH Semantic Documentation pipeline on **ONE OBJECT** in
isolated regen-harness mode. This is NOT the normal batch loop. You are NOT
reading `_index.md`, NOT updating any index file, NOT processing other
objects, NOT running cross-schema sync. You document one object end-to-end and
exit.

---

## ⛔ MCP PRE-FLIGHT — MANDATORY

Before reading any rule files or DDL:

1. Call `mcp__synapse_sql__execute_sql_read_only` with `SELECT 1 AS mcp_preflight`.
2. **If it fails or the tool does not exist**: print `REGEN ABORT: Synapse MCP unavailable` and **EXIT IMMEDIATELY**. A wiki without live data sampling is INCOMPLETE and WILL FAIL the adversarial judge.
3. **If it succeeds**: print `MCP PRE-FLIGHT: PASS` and continue.

No exceptions. No "code-only documentation" fallback. No "I'll skip Phase 2 because the table looks dormant" — the judge sees the dormant footer too and will fail you for missing data evidence.

---

## ⛔ REGEN-HARNESS BREVITY OVERRIDE

This is a regen-harness run; we are optimising for token efficiency. The judge's
HARD assertions (8 sections present; ETL diagram in 5.2; Element table shape; row
count = DDL column count; Tier suffix on every Element row) all REMAIN MANDATORY.
Soft prose around them is CAPPED — defer to these caps even when the
GOLDEN-REFERENCE example (Dim_Mirror) shows verbose prose.

| Section | Cap |
|---|---|
| 1. Business Meaning | <=120 words. One paragraph. Must include row count, date range, ETL SP, source. |
| 2. Business Logic | <=2 subsections; each <=80 words What/Columns/Rules. Skip section entirely if no non-trivial logic. |
| 3.1 Distribution & Index | <=2 sentences. |
| 3.2 Common Query Patterns | Table only, max 3 rows, no commentary. |
| 3.3 Common JOINs | Table only, max 3 rows, no commentary. |
| 3.4 Gotchas | <=4 bullets, one line each. |
| 4. Elements | Each row Description: ONE sentence ending `(Tier N — source)`. No multi-sentence per-column descriptions. Inline dictionary values when <=15 distinct (per GOLDEN-REFERENCE Section C). |
| 5.2 ETL Pipeline | Diagram + 1 sentence below. No additional prose. |
| 6. Relationships | Tables only, no prose around them. |
| 7. Sample Queries | EXACTLY 2 queries. One sentence header each, no explanation paragraph. |
| 8. Atlassian Knowledge | Bullets only. |

These caps cut output from ~22K tokens to ~10K tokens per object. Keep the
information density HIGH, drop the explanation/narrative prose. The wiki is for
analysts and AI agents who already know the domain — they do not need essay-style
context.

---

## ⛔ PHASE 3 DISTRIBUTION CAP

Phase 3 (distribution analysis) is capped at **at most 3 categorical columns**
per object. Pick those whose names match the regex
`Status|Type|Code|Country|Region|Currency|Category|Reg|Score|Group|Kind|Class`.
Skip free-text columns entirely (Email, Description, Comment, Note, Address,
Name, Url, Subject, Body, Reason).

If fewer than 3 columns match the regex, run distribution queries on however
many DO match — running zero distribution queries is OK if the table has no
obviously-categorical columns.

---

## ⛔ OUTPUT DIRECTORY GUARANTEE

The directory listed under **Absolute output directory** in the Object Header
ALREADY EXISTS, was created by the harness, and is empty (apart from the
writer_prompt.md you are reading). DO NOT run `Bash ls` to check it. DO NOT
run `Bash mkdir`. Just call `Write` directly with the absolute paths from the
Object Header for the three required files.

---

## ⛔ PRE-RESOLVED UPSTREAM CONTEXT — your Tier 1 inheritance source is below, USE IT

The block titled **"## PRE-RESOLVED UPSTREAM BUNDLE"** in this prompt was
assembled **deterministically by the harness, before you started**. It contains:

- The **DDL** for the object you are documenting (verbatim from SSDT).
- Every **upstream wiki** the harness could resolve from the existing
  `.lineage.md` plus DDL-derived references — both local Synapse wikis and
  remote production-DB wikis (DB_Schema, ExperianceDBs, etc.).
- For any stored procedure mentioned in the lineage, the **SP source code**
  pulled from `DataPlatform\SynapseSQLPool1\sql_dp_prod_we\...`.

**Treat this bundle as your AUTHORITATIVE source for Tier 1 inheritance.** You
are NOT permitted to claim "no upstream wiki could be found" if the bundle
contains one. You ARE permitted to read additional files via the `Read` tool
if you need more context.

### Tier rules — re-stated, NON-NEGOTIABLE

For every column in the object:

1. **Passthrough or rename WITH upstream wiki present in the bundle** →
   **Tier 1**. Description MUST be a verbatim quote from the upstream wiki.
   Do not paraphrase. Do not "improve". Do not generalize vendor names. Do not
   drop NULL semantics. The judge will run a character-by-character
   comparison.
2. **ETL-computed** (CASE / arithmetic / aggregation visible in the SP source) →
   **Tier 2** with the transform stated.
3. **Dim-lookup passthrough** (`SELECT dim.X` with no transform AND `Dim_X`
   has its own Tier 1 origin documented in the bundle) → **Tier 1 with the
   dim's origin** (e.g. `Dictionary.Country`), NOT `Tier 2 via SP_X` and NOT
   `Tier 1 via Dim_X` (Dim_X is a relay, not a root). Quote the dim's wiki
   verbatim.
4. **No source traceable from bundle, DDL, JOINs, or SP source** →
   **Tier 3** with explicit reason. Be specific: "PII column, no upstream wiki
   located, name suggests …".
5. **`Tier 4 — inferred from name`** is BANNED unless the bundle explicitly
   shows the column has no upstream and no SP code touches it. Lazy Tier 4 is
   the #1 reason wikis fail the judge. If you are tempted to write Tier 4
   with no other evidence, you have skipped Phase 9 — go back and read the
   SP source in the bundle.

### Footer rules

- If the bundle contains AT LEAST ONE upstream wiki: the footer MUST identify
  the production source(s). Writing `Production Source: Unknown (dormant)`
  when the bundle proves an upstream exists is an automatic fail.
- If `_no_upstream_found.txt` exists in the regen folder: it is OK to mark
  the table as dormant in the footer, but you MUST still ground every column
  description in the DDL + SP code rather than `Tier 4 — inferred`.

---

## Output paths — write here, NOT into the main wiki tree

Write all THREE output files into:

```
audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/
  {Object}.md
  {Object}.lineage.md
  {Object}.review-needed.md
```

`{Schema}`, `{Object}`, and `{N}` are passed in via the prompt header below.

**DO NOT** write into `knowledge/synapse/Wiki/` under any circumstances. The
main tree is read-only for this run. **DO NOT** modify `_index.md` or any
`_batch_context.json`. **DO NOT** generate `.alter.sql`. **DO NOT** run Phase
16 — the adversarial judge runs as a separate, fresh claude process AFTER you
exit. Pretending to evaluate yourself wastes tokens.

---

## Pipeline scope for this single object

Run phases 1 through 11 inclusive. Skip Phase 16. Skip Phase 11W (no ALTER).
Skip cross-object index updates. Skip `_batch_context.json` writes.

Required phase gates (you must print them as you complete each):

```
PHASE GATE — {Schema}.{Object}:
  [x] P1 DDL          [x] P2 Sample        [x] P3 Dist
  [x] P4 Lookup       [x] P5 JOIN          [x] P6 BizLogic
  [x] P7 Views        [x] P8 SP-scan       [x] P9 SP-logic
  [x] P9B ETL         [x] P10 Jira         [x] P10A Upstream
  [x] P10B Lineage    → Ready for P11
```

If a phase truly cannot run (e.g. no SPs reference the table), mark it `[-]`
with a one-line reason. Skipping P2 or P3 because "the table is small" is
NOT a valid reason — sample it.

---

## Outputs — three files, exact shape

Follow the GOLDEN-REFERENCE in
`.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/GOLDEN-REFERENCE.mdc`.

1. **`{Object}.lineage.md`** — written FIRST (Phase 10B). Source Objects
   table + Column Lineage table. Every Tier 1 row must point to a file in the
   pre-resolved bundle (or to a wiki you read independently).
2. **`{Object}.md`** — the main wiki, 8 sections, every column in
   Section 4's Elements table, every description ending with
   `(Tier N — source)`.
3. **`{Object}.review-needed.md`** — items needing human review. MUST NOT
   contain a `## 4. Elements` section.

---

## Final checklist before exiting

Print, verbatim:

```
OUTPUT CHECK — {Schema}.{Object}:
  [x] .lineage.md    written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.lineage.md
  [x] .md            written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.md
  [x] .review-needed.md written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.review-needed.md
  [-] .alter.sql     deferred (regen harness — judge runs next)
  Tier1 columns: N    Tier2: N    Tier3: N    Tier4: N
  Bundle inheritance used: YES/NO  (NO is only valid if `_no_upstream_found.txt` exists)
```

Then EXIT. Do not run a self-evaluation. Do not "double-check by re-reading
the wiki you just wrote". Do not append a verdict block. The judge runs in a
separate process with its own context.

# build-wiki-bidb-batch

You are running the DWH Semantic Documentation pipeline for schema BI_DB_dbo.
**Wiki-only mode** — generate documentation files only. ALTER scripts are generated separately later via `/generate-alter-dwh`.

## ⛔ MCP PRE-FLIGHT — NON-NEGOTIABLE, CHECK BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

Before loading rules, before reading the index, before planning anything:

1. **Test Synapse MCP**: Call `mcp__synapse_sql__execute_sql_read_only` with `SELECT 1 AS mcp_preflight`
2. **If it fails or the tool does not exist**: Print `BATCH ABORT: Synapse MCP unavailable` and **EXIT IMMEDIATELY**. Do NOT proceed. Do NOT fall back to "prior batch context data". Do NOT use a "schema practice" of skipping MCP. A wiki without live data sampling is INCOMPLETE and WILL NOT PASS the adversarial evaluator. STOP HERE.
3. **If it succeeds**: Print `MCP PRE-FLIGHT: PASS` and continue to Instructions.

There is NO exception to this rule. No "prior context", no "code-only documentation", no "graceful degradation". MCP down = batch aborted. Period.

---

## Instructions (regen-harness, single object)

1. **Load rules** — read these in order before anything else:
   - `.cursor/rules/semantic-layer-core/repo-first-access.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/00-execution-card.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/mcp-query-rules.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/GOLDEN-REFERENCE.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/10.5b-tier1-enforcement.mdc`

2. **Skip batch planning** — do NOT read `_index.md`, do NOT touch
   `_batch_context.json`, do NOT scan the blacklist. The harness
   already chose this object.

3. **Run the pipeline for THIS object only**: phases 1 through 11
   inclusive. Use the pre-resolved upstream bundle (provided below)
   as your authoritative Tier 1 source. Generate three files in
   `audits/regen-sample/{schema}/{object}/regen/attempt_{N}/`:
   `.lineage.md`, `.md`, `.review-needed.md`. Do NOT generate
   `.alter.sql`. Do NOT modify any file under `knowledge/synapse/Wiki/`.

4. **Skip Phase 16** — the adversarial judge runs in a separate,
   fresh claude process after you exit. Self-evaluation here wastes
   tokens and pollutes the comparison.

5. **Exit cleanly** after printing the OUTPUT CHECK block defined in
   the Regen Harness preamble.

## Key resources

- **SSDT DDL files**: `C:\Users\guyman\Documents\github\DataPlatform\` (repo-first for structure)

---

## 1. Business Meaning

Fact_SnapshotCustomer is the central customer state table in the DWH. For every eToro customer (RealCID), it holds one row per distinct attribute state within a year, recording which attributes were active between FromDate and ToDate (encoded together in `DateRangeID`). The pattern is SCD Type 2 by year: each year's rows are closed as attribute changes occur, and a new open row is created with the updated state. At year-end, all open rows are closed and reopened with the new year's date range.

As of 2026-03-19: **406M+ total rows**, **46.4M distinct customers**, data from **2007-08-22 to present**. 302M rows are "currently open" (ToDate = year-end). 11.9% of current open rows represent depositors; 98.0% are valid customers (IsValidCustomer=1).

The SP loads data from 6 source systems via staging Ext_FSC tables pre-populated by SP_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_DL_To_Synapse. The core CC (Customer Core) source provides demographics and status; the BO (Back Office) source provides risk/compliance attributes. RegulationID is taken from RegulationChangeLog — **not** from Back Office — because regulation changes take effect end-of-day.

8 legacy columns (DemoCID, CustomerChangeTypeID, CurentValue, PreviousValue, DocsOK, Bankruptcy, PremiumAccount, Evangelist) are present in the DDL but NOT populated by the current SP. They carry DEFAULT (0) values.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 SCD Type 2 Pattern — DateRangeID

**What**: Each customer-state row has a DateRangeID encoding both the open date (FromDate) and close date (ToDate) as a 12-digit bigint.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `RealCID`

**Rules**:
- DateRangeID = `YYYYMMDD` (open date, 8 chars) + `MMDDD` (year-end month+day, 4 chars) → e.g., `202603101231` = opened 2026-03-10, closes 2026-12-31
- When an attribute changes, the SP updates DateRangeID of the existing row to close it (right 4 chars become yesterday's MMDD), then inserts a new row with today's open date + year-end
- To get the **most current row** per customer: `RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4) = '1231'`
- On January 1st: all prior year's open rows are closed (12-31) and re-opened for the new year
- The `Dim_Range` dimension table stores FromDateID + ToDateID for each DateRangeID

### 2.2 IsValidCustomer — Segment Flag

**What**: Computed flag indicating whether a customer is a "valid" retail customer for analytics (excludes demo, blocked countries, excluded labels).

**Columns Involved**: `IsValidCustomer`, `PlayerLevelID`, `LabelID`, `CountryID`

**Rules** (as of post-2020-03-14):
```
IsValidCustomer = 1 IF:
  PlayerLevelID <> 4 (not demo)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (30, 26) (not internal/excluded label)
  AND CountryID <> 250 (not blocked country)
ELSE 0
```
Pre-2020-03-14 rule additionally excluded AccountTypeID=9.

### 2.3 IsCreditReportValidCB — Credit Reporting Flag

**What**: Flag indicating whether a customer is eligible for credit report validation (CB = CreditBureau context).

**Columns Involved**: `IsCreditReportValidCB`, `PlayerLevelID`, `AccountTypeID`, `LabelID`, `CountryID`

**Rules** (as of post-2020-03-14):
```
IsCreditReportValidCB = 1 IF:
  NOT (PlayerLevelID = 4 AND AccountTypeID <> 2)  (not non-real demo)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (26, 30)
  AND NOT (CountryID = 250 AND CID NOT IN (3400616, 10526243))
ELSE 0
```

### 2.4 RegulationID — End-of-Day Rule

**What**: A customer's regulatory jurisdiction is taken from RegulationChangeLog (end-of-day change), NOT from the back-office system (immediate change), because regulation changes take effect at end of day for business/legal reasons.

**Columns Involved**: `RegulationID`, sourced from `Ext_FSC_BackOffice_RegulationChangeLog.ToRegulationID`

### 2.5 GDPR Erasure Masking

**What**: When a GDPR deletion request is processed, the UserName in Customer Core gets a `DelUserName` prefix. The SP detects this and masks Email, City, Address, Zip, and PhoneNumber in Fact_SnapshotCustomer.

**Columns Involved**: `Email`, `City`, `Address`, `Zip`, `PhoneNumber`

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, HASH(RealCID) distribution + CCI makes per-customer aggregations and filters on RealCID highly efficient — queries that filter or join on RealCID benefit from colocation. The NCI on RealCID provides efficient point-lookup for single customers.

**Warning**: With 406M rows, full table scans are expensive. Always filter by DateRangeID or a specific year range when possible.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage

**In Databricks**, the data is accessed via `V_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_FromDateID` (generic_id=1115), not directly. Two UC targets:
- `pii_data.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_v_fact_snapshotcustomer_fromdateid` — full PII (gated access)
- `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_v_fact_snapshotcustomer_fromdateid_masked` — Email/City/Address/Zip masked

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Current state for all customers | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` |
| Current state for one customer | `WHERE RealCID = @cid AND RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` |
| Customer state on a specific date | `WHERE RealCID = @cid AND LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),8) <= @date AND RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) >= RIGHT(@date, 4)` |
| Count of depositors | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231' AND IsDepositor = 1` |
| Valid retail customers | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231' AND IsValidCustomer = 1` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Country | ON f.CountryID = dc.CountryID | Country name/region |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Label | ON f.LabelID = dl.LabelID | Brand/label name |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Language | ON f.LanguageID = dl.LanguageID | Customer language |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_VerificationLevel | ON f.VerificationLevelID = dv.VerificationLevelID | KYC verification status |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_PlayerStatus | ON f.PlayerStatusID = dp.PlayerStatusID | Account lifecycle status |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Regulation | ON f.RegulationID = dr.RegulationID | Regulatory jurisdiction |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_AccountStatus | ON f.AccountStatusID = das.AccountStatusID | Account enabled/disabled |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Range | ON f.DateRangeID = dr.DateRangeID | Decode FromDateID + ToDateID |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_Guru_Copiers | ON f.RealCID = fg.RealCID | Copy-trading activity |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **DateRangeID is NOT a date** — it is a 12-digit bigint encoding (FromDate)(ToDate MMDD). Always extract with LEFT(...,8) for FromDate and RIGHT(...,4) for ToDate MMDD.
- **Most-current-row filter**: `RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` gets the currently open row, but after year-end closure this may temporarily return 0 rows. Use `MAX(DateRangeID)` per RealCID as a safer alternative.
- **Legacy columns with 0 defaults**: DemoCID, CustomerChangeTypeID, CurentValue, PreviousValue, DocsOK, Bankruptcy, PremiumAccount, Evangelist are all DEFAULT 0 and NOT populated by the current SP. Do not rely on them.
- **PII masking**: Email, City, Address, Zip are dynamically masked (`MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'default()')`). Users without `UNMASK` permission see NULL. PhoneNumber is NOT masked at DDL level but is GDPR-erased via the SP for deleted users.
- **WeekendFeePrecentage** (note: typo in column name — "Precentage" instead of "Percentage") — use as-is.
- **AccountStatusID distribution**: 1=93.2% (Active), 0=6.1% (unknown/default), 2=0.9% (Inactive). Only 3 distinct values observed.
- **Not exported directly to UC** — join via `V_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_FromDateID` in UC.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_Range is a DWH-internal helper lookup that pre-computes all possible (FromDate, ToDate) date range pairs needed by the Snapshot analytics pipelines. Each row represents a unique start-to-end date interval, identified by a composite BigInt key (DateRangeID). The table enables efficient range-based JOINs in SnapshotEquity and SnapshotCustomer views without requiring date arithmetic at query time.

This table has no external production source. It is generated entirely within the DWH by SP_Fact_SnapshotEquity and SP_Fact_SnapshotCustomer, which INSERT new DateRangeID combinations as they encounter new date pairs during snapshot processing. The pattern is append-only - new rows are added daily but existing rows are never updated or deleted.

As of 2026-03-10, the table contains approximately 1.3 million date range pairs spanning from 2007-01-01 to 2026-03-10 on the FromDate side, and 2007-08-26 to 2026-12-31 on the ToDate side.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 DateRangeID Encoding

**What**: DateRangeID is a deterministic composite key encoding both FromDate and MMDD(ToDate) into a single 12-digit BigInt.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `FromDateID`, `ToDateID`

**Rules**:
- Formula: `DateRangeID = CONCAT(YYYYMMDD(FromDate), MMDD(ToDate))`
- Example: FromDateID=20070101, ToDateID=20071231 -> DateRangeID=200701011231
- Decoding FromDateID: `CONVERT(INT, LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 8))`
- Decoding ToDateID: `CONVERT(INT, LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4) + RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4))`
- The YEAR component of ToDateID is always the SAME as the YEAR of FromDateID (only MMDD of ToDate is stored in the last 4 digits)

**Diagram**:
```
DateRangeID (12-digit BigInt):
  [ YYYY | MM | DD | MM | DD ]
  [  From Year  | From MMDD  | To MMDD ]
   |___________|             |________|
   Chars 1-8 = FromDateID    Chars 9-12 = MMDD(ToDate)

  ToDateID = YYYY(FromDate) + MMDD(ToDate)
  -> Year-end range example:
     FromDate=2020-03-15, ToDate=2020-12-31
     DateRangeID = 202003151231
     ToDateID    = 20201231
```

### 2.2 Snapshot Range Pattern

**What**: Dim_Range is the bridge between individual customer dates and fiscal/calendar year-end periods in Snapshot reports.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `FromDateID`, `ToDateID`

**Rules**:
- The primary use case is "from customer registration/event date to year-end": FromDate = customer's start date, ToDate = December 31 of that year
- The SPs also generate non-year-end ranges when snapshots require partial-period measurements
- The table grows daily as new snapshot dates are processed
- No deduplication needed - DateRangeID uniqueness is enforced by the NOT EXISTS check in both SPs

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with a composite CLUSTERED INDEX on (DateRangeID, FromDateID, ToDateID) and three Non-Clustered Indexes: IX_Dim_Range_FromDateID, IX_Dim_Range_ToDateID, and IX_Dim_Range_FromDateID_ToDateID. The NCI indexes are unusual for Synapse (which typically uses only CCI) and suggest heavy range-based lookups by the Snapshot SPs. Always filter on FromDateID or ToDateID directly to leverage these indexes.

Note: PRIMARY KEY (DateRangeID) is declared NOT ENFORCED - Synapse does not validate uniqueness but the ETL SPs maintain it via NOT EXISTS guards.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, the Gold export at `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_range` is Parquet. With 1.3M rows, consider filtering on FromDateID for performance.

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotEquity | DateRangeID | Resolve snapshot equity date ranges |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer | DateRangeID | Resolve snapshot customer date ranges |
| DWH_dbo.V_Fact_SnapshotEquity | DateRangeID | View-level access to snapshot equity with resolved ranges |
| DWH_dbo.V_M2M_Date_DateRange | DateRangeID | Month-to-month date range bridging |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **ToDate YEAR = FromDate YEAR**: The DateRangeID encoding only stores MMDD of ToDate. The year of ToDate is derived from FromDate's year. This means all ranges in this table are within-year ranges - cross-year ranges cannot be represented.
- **INSERT-only, no TRUNCATE**: Both writer SPs use NOT EXISTS guards, making the table append-only. Rows are never deleted. If a DateRangeID is erroneously created, it persists forever.
- **Primary key NOT ENFORCED**: Synapse does not verify uniqueness of DateRangeID. Trust the ETL logic, not the constraint.
- **DateRangeID is a STRING-derived number**: Always treat DateRangeID as a derived key, not a business ID. Decode using LEFT/RIGHT string operations if needed.
- **1.3M rows for a dim table**: Larger than typical dimensions. REPLICATE is appropriate given daily Snapshot SP joins from all distributions.

## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Fact_BillingDeposit` is the DWH's authoritative record of every deposit attempt on the eToro platform — approved, declined, pending, charged back, or refunded. With 73.9M rows, it is the primary billing analytics table, used for FTD (First Time Deposit) attribution, payment provider performance, fraud analysis, exchange revenue reporting, regulatory compliance segmentation, and customer lifecycle analytics.

The table combines data from three production sources:
1. **`Billing.Deposit`** — the core deposit ledger (direct passthrough for 35 columns)
2. **`Billing.Funding`** — payment instrument details (FundingTypeID, IsRefundExcluded, DocumentRequired, AFT flags)
3. **`Billing.RecurringDeposit`** — recurring deposit configuration (OUTER APPLY for IsRecurring flag)

Additionally, ~91 columns are extracted from XML blobs stored in `Billing.Deposit.PaymentData` and `Billing.Deposit.FundingData` using the DWH UDF `ExtractXMLValue`. These cover payment-method-specific fields that vary by funding type (credit card BIN details, bank account info, e-wallet data, etc.).

**ETL pattern** (`SP_Fact_BillingDeposit_DL_To_Synapse`):
1. DELETE rows from `Ext_FBD_Fact_BillingDeposit` for the ModificationDateID window
2. INSERT from staging into Ext_FBD (multi-source JOIN + XML extraction)
3. DELETE from main `Fact_BillingDeposit` for the window
4. INSERT from Ext_FBD into Fact_BillingDeposit
5. UPDATE `PlatformID` from `Fact_CustomerAction` WHERE ActionTypeID=14 matching on SessionID (second SP pass: `EXEC SP_Fact_BillingDeposit @Yesterday`)

**Amount capping**: As of 2025-04-17, an `Amount CASE` expression caps extreme values before storage to prevent outlier distortion in aggregations.

**PlatformID enrichment**: The platform the customer used when depositing is not stored in Billing.Deposit — it is looked up via a session-to-platform join against `Fact_CustomerAction` (ActionTypeID=14, session-based match) in a second ETL pass.

**Upstream wiki**: `Billing.Deposit` has a full upstream wiki (documented in DB_Schema) providing Tier 1 column descriptions for 35 DWH columns.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Deposit Status Lifecycle

**What**: Deposits progress through states from submission through approval, decline, or reversal.

**Columns Involved**: `PaymentStatusID`, `RiskManagementStatusID`, `MatchStatusID`

**Rules**:
- `PaymentStatusID=2` (Approved) is the only successful terminal state — drives customer account crediting via Billing.AmountAdd in production
- `PaymentStatusID=35` (DeclineByRRE) represents real-time risk engine declines (~10.2% of deposits)
- `PaymentStatusID=13` (Pending), `5` (InProcess): intermediate states for offline/wire deposits
- States 11-12, 26, 37-39 represent post-approval reversals (Chargeback, Refund, and their reversals)
- For full state machine, see upstream wiki: Billing.Deposit §2.1

### 2.2 First Time Deposit (FTD)

**What**: `IsFTD=1` marks the customer's first ever approved deposit — the event that triggers marketing attribution and FTD bonus eligibility.

**Columns Involved**: `IsFTD`, `CID`, `DepositID`

**Rules**:
- Only one deposit per customer can have `IsFTD=1` (monotonic guarantee from production)
- `IsFTD=0` for DepositTypeID=4 (MoneyTransfer/internal transfer) regardless of deposit history
- ~60.6% of Billing.Deposit rows have IsFTD=1 (many customers deposit exactly once)
- DWH stores this as `int` (0/1) rather than `bit` in production

### 2.3 Amount and Exchange Rate

**What**: Deposits are stored in deposit currency (CurrencyID) and pre-computed to USD (AmountUSD).

**Columns Involved**: `Amount`, `CurrencyID`, `ExchangeRate`, `BaseExchangeRate`, `ExchangeFee`, `AmountUSD`

**Rules**:
- `Amount` is in deposit currency; stored as MONEY (4 decimal places)
- As of 2025-04-17: Amount is capped via CASE expression before storage (prevents extreme outlier values)
- `AmountUSD = Amount × ExchangeRate` (DWH-computed in ETL)
- `BaseExchangeRate` stores the rate before fee markup; `ExchangeFee` stores the fee
- For USD deposits: ExchangeRate=1.0, AmountUSD=Amount

### 2.4 XML-Extracted Payment Data (~91 Columns)

**What**: `Billing.Deposit.PaymentData` and `FundingData` store provider-specific XML blobs. The DWH ETL extracts ~91 attributes using `ExtractXMLValue(xml_blob, attribute_name)` into dedicated nvarchar(max) columns.

**Rules**:
- Each `*AsString`, `*AsDecimal`, `*AsInteger` suffix column is a single XML attribute extracted by name
- The payment data schema varies by FundingTypeID — credit card deposits populate card-specific fields; bank wire deposits populate bank-specific fields; e-wallet deposits populate e-wallet fields
- NULL in any XML column means either: (a) the attribute doesn't exist for this funding type, or (b) it was absent from the XML for this deposit
- `ThreeDsResponseType` is a notable XML-extracted field — joins to Dim_ThreeDsResponseTypes via TRY_CAST(...AS INT)

### 2.5 Platform Attribution

**What**: `PlatformID` identifies the device/platform the customer was on when making the deposit (web, iOS, Android, etc.).

**Columns Involved**: `PlatformID`, `SessionID`

**Rules**:
- `PlatformID` is NOT from Billing.Deposit — it's populated via a second ETL pass:
  `UPDATE Fact_BillingDeposit SET PlatformID = (SELECT PlatformID FROM Fact_CustomerAction WHERE ActionTypeID=14 AND SessionID = Fact_BillingDeposit.SessionID)`
- If no matching Fact_CustomerAction row exists for the session, PlatformID remains NULL
- ActionTypeID=14 represents a "Deposit" action type in Fact_CustomerAction

### 2.6 Recurring Deposits

**What**: `IsRecurring` identifies deposits that are part of a scheduled recurring deposit plan.

**Columns Involved**: `IsRecurring`, `DepositID`

**Rules**:
- `IsRecurring = 1` when a matching row exists in `Billing.RecurringDeposit` for this deposit (OUTER APPLY)
- `IsRecurring = 0` for one-time deposits
- Recurring deposits may have DepositTypeID=3 (Recurring) or DepositTypeID=5 (RecurringInvestment)

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

`HASH(DepositID)` ensures even distribution — each deposit has a unique ID so this is an optimal hash key for point lookups and JOINs by deposit. The clustered index on `DepositID` makes per-deposit point lookups fast. The NC index on `(PaymentStatusID, ExpirationDateID)` supports filtered queries by status and expiration date.

**Warning**: At 73.9M rows, full-table scans are expensive. Always filter by `ModificationDateID` or `PaymentStatusID`.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Daily approved deposit volume | WHERE PaymentStatusID=2, GROUP BY ModificationDateID |
| FTD analysis | WHERE IsFTD=1 AND PaymentStatusID=2 |
| Exchange fee revenue | SUM(AmountUSD - Amount/ExchangeRate×BaseExchangeRate) |
| Regulation-specific deposits | WHERE ProcessRegulationID = @regId |
| Platform breakdown | GROUP BY PlatformID (JOIN Dim_Platform) |
| 3DS outcome analysis | TRY_CAST(ThreeDsResponseType AS INT) JOIN Dim_ThreeDsResponseTypes |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON CID | Customer demographics |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Date | ON ModificationDateID | Time dimension |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Currency | ON CurrencyID | Currency name |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Platform | ON PlatformID | Device/platform |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_ThreeDsResponseTypes | ON TRY_CAST(ThreeDsResponseType AS INT) | 3DS outcome |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **73.9M rows**: Always filter. Prefer ModificationDateID or ExpirationDateID index for range queries
- **XML columns are all nvarchar(max)**: Aggregating or joining on XML-extracted columns requires TRY_CAST — they are stored as strings regardless of semantic type
- **`v` column**: This unnamed column (`v`) is an XML-extracted field with no descriptive name — artifact of the XML schema. Contents unknown without domain review
- **PlatformID may be NULL**: Session-to-platform join succeeds only if the deposit session was logged in Fact_CustomerAction
- **AmountUSD is ETL-computed**: Not from production; recalculated as Amount×ExchangeRate at ETL time. For exact USD reconciliation, use Amount×ExchangeRate directly
- **ExpirationDateID formula**: Complex derived calculation from ExpirationDateAsString XML field — not a simple date conversion

## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Fact_CustomerAction` is the unified customer event log for the eToro platform. Every significant action a customer performs — opening a position, closing a position, depositing money, withdrawing, logging in, publishing a social post, receiving a fee, getting a bonus, registering an account — is captured as a single row in this table. It answers: "What did this customer do, when, and what were the financial details?"

The table consolidates events from five distinct production sources into a single ActionTypeID-driven schema:
1. **Position opens** (ActionTypeID 1-3, 39): From `Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay` via the Generic Pipeline + staging
2. **Position closes** (ActionTypeID 4-6, 28, 40): From `History.ClosePositionEndOfDay` via the Generic Pipeline + staging
3. **Credit/financial events** (ActionTypeID 7-13, 15-20, 27, 30, 32, 34-38, 42-45): From `History.Credit` (which unions `History.ActiveCredit` + archived Credit partition tables back to 2007)
4. **Logins** (ActionTypeID 14): From `STS_Audit_UserOperationsData` (Session Tracking Service) with platform/browser detection
5. **Registrations** (ActionTypeID 41): From `Customer.CustomerStatic`

Because the table unions fundamentally different event types, **most columns are only populated for specific ActionTypeIDs**. Position-related columns (InstrumentID, Leverage, Commission, IsBuy, etc.) are NULL/0 for non-position events. Fee-specific columns (IsFeeDividend, DividendID) are only set for ActionTypeID=35. This is a sparse fact table by design.

The data originates from production systems, flows through the Azure Data Lake and DWH staging tables, and is loaded by `SP_Fact_CustomerAction_DL_To_Synapse` (staging extract) and `SP_Fact_CustomerAction` (transform + load). Post-load, `SP_Fact_CustomerAction_IsParitalCloseParent` marks partial-close parents. The load uses SWITCH partition for daily increments.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 ActionTypeID — Event Classification

**What**: Every row is classified by ActionTypeID, which determines what type of customer action occurred and which columns are populated.

**Columns Involved**: `ActionTypeID`, mapped via `DWH_dbo.Dim_ActionType`

**Rules**:

| ActionTypeID | Name | Category | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ManualPositionOpen | PositionOpen | Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay — MirrorID=0, OrigParentPositionID=0 |
| 2 | CopyPositionOpen | PositionOpen | Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay — MirrorID>0, OrigParentPositionID>0 |
| 3 | CopyPlusPositionOpen | PositionOpen | Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay — MirrorID=0, OrigParentPositionID>0 |
| 4 | ManualPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 5 | CopyPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 6 | CopyPlusPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 7 | Deposit | Deposit | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=1) |
| 8 | Cashout | Cashout | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=2) |
| 9 | Bonus | Bonus | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=7) |
| 10 | Cashout request | Cashout request | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=9) |
| 11 | Chargeback | Chargeback | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=11) |
| 12 | Refund | Refund | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=12) |
| 14 | LoggedIn | LoggedIn | STS_Audit_UserOperationsData |
| 15 | Account balance to mirror | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=18) |
| 16 | Mirror balance to account | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=19) |
| 17 | Register new mirror | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=20) |
| 18 | Unregister mirror | Mirror ops | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=21) |
| 19 | Detach position from mirror | DetachPosition | History.Credit |
| 21-26 | Publish Post/Comment/Like, Received Post/Comment/Like | Social engagement | **DEAD DATA** — legacy rows exist but no longer updated. No active ETL. |
| 27 | DepositAttempt | DepositAttempt | History.Credit |
| 28 | DetachedPositionClose | PositionClose | History.ClosePositionEndOfDay |
| 29 | Cashier Loggin | Cashier login | Billing.Login |
| 30 | Processed Cashout | Processed Cashout | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=2 processed) |
| 32 | Edit StopLoss | Edit StopLoss | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=13) |
| 34 | Open Stock Order | Stock order | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=29) |
| 35 | End Of The Week Fee | Fees | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=14) — overnight, weekend, dividend, SDRT, ticket fees |
| 36 | Compensation | Compensation | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=6) |
| 37 | Reverse cashout | Reverse cashout | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=8) |
| 38 | Affiliate Deposit | Deposit | History.Credit |
| 39 | PositionOpenTypeUnknown | PositionOpen | Position open without matching History.Credit (fix at weekly maintenance) |
| 40 | PositionCloseTypeUnknown | PositionClose | Position close without matching History.Credit |
| 41 | Customer Registration | Registration | Customer.CustomerStatic |
| 42 | Cashout Rollback | Chargeback | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=33) |
| 43 | Reverse Deposit | Reverse Deposit | History.Credit (CreditTypeID=32) |
| 44 | InternalDeposit | Deposit | History.Credit (MoveMoneyReasonID=5) |
| 45 | InternalWithdraw | Withdraw | History.Credit (MoveMoneyReasonID=5) |

### 2.2 IsFeeDividend — Fee Sub-Classification

**What**: For ActionTypeID=35 (End of Week Fee), classifies the specific fee type.

**Columns Involved**: `IsFeeDividend`, `Description`

**Rules** (per DSM-1463):
- `1` = Overnight/weekend fee (Description: "Over night fee", "Weekend fee")
- `2` = Dividend payment (Description LIKE '%dividend%')
- `3` = SDRT charge (Description LIKE '%sdrt%')
- `4` = Ticket fees (Description: "OpenTotalFees" or "CloseTotalFees")
- `NULL` = Not ActionTypeID=35

### 2.3 Position-Derived Columns (Shared with Dim_Position)

**What**: ~33 columns in Fact_CustomerAction are copies of the same data from `Trade.OpenPositionEndOfDay` / `History.ClosePositionEndOfDay` that also populates `DWH_dbo.Dim_Position`. These columns display the same data under the same column names but are populated independently at ETL time.

**Shared columns**: `PositionID`, `InstrumentID`, `Amount`, `Leverage`, `Commission`, `CommissionOnClose`, `FullCommission`, `FullCommissionOnClose`, `MirrorID`, `IsSettled`, `InitialUnits`, `IsDiscounted`, `CommissionByUnits`, `FullCommissionByUnits`, `RegulationIDOnOpen`, `ReopenForPositionID`, `IsReOpen`, `CommissionOnCloseOrig`, `FullCommissionOnCloseOrig`, `OriginalPositionID`, `IsPartialCloseParent`, `IsPartialCloseChild`, `IsAirDrop`, `SettlementTypeID`, `DLTOpen`, `DLTClose`, `OpenMarkupByUnits`, `IsBuy`, `NetProfit`, `RedeemStatus`, `RedeemID`, `IsRedeem`

**Rules**:
- These columns are ONLY populated for position events (ActionTypeID IN 1-6, 28, 39, 40)
- For non-position events, these columns are 0 or NULL
- The ETL joins from staging tables directly — NOT from Dim_Position itself
- Column meanings are identical to Dim_Position (see `Dim_Position.md` for detailed descriptions)

### 2.4 PlatformID — Product/Platform Resolution

**What**: Identifies which product/platform the action originated from. Badly named — it's actually a FK to `Dim_Product.ProductID`, not a standalone platform enum.

**Columns Involved**: `PlatformID`

**Rules**:
- Only populated for ActionTypeID=14 (logins) and 41 (registrations)
- Resolve via JOIN to `DWH_dbo.Dim_Product` — provides Product, Platform, and SubPlatform columns
- Do NOT hard-code value mappings (101=Android, etc.) — always JOIN to Dim_Product

**Query pattern**:
```sql
SELECT dp.Product, dp.Platform, dp.SubPlatform, fca.*
FROM DWH_dbo.Fact_CustomerAction fca
JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_Product dp ON fca.PlatformID = dp.ProductID
WHERE fca.ActionTypeID = 14
```

### 2.6 Reopen Commission Adjustment

**What**: For reopened positions (IsReOpen=1), the commission at close is adjusted.

**Columns Involved**: `CommissionOnClose`, `FullCommissionOnClose`, `CommissionOnCloseOrig`, `FullCommissionOnCloseOrig`, `IsReOpen`, `ReopenForPositionID`

**Rules**:
- `CommissionOnClose = new_position.CommissionOnClose - original_position.CommissionOnClose`
- `CommissionOnCloseOrig` / `FullCommissionOnCloseOrig` preserve original values

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is HASH-distributed on `RealCID` with a CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX + 4 nonclustered indexes (`ActionTypeID+DateID`, `ActionTypeID`, `CompensationReasonID`, `RealCID+DateID`). Always include `RealCID` in WHERE or JOIN for optimal single-distribution queries. The columnstore index enables efficient analytical scans across the ~11B rows.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, this table is stored as **Delta** (EXTERNAL, ~430 GB, ~7K files), partitioned by `etr_y`, `etr_ym`, `etr_ymd` (year, year-month, year-month-day). Always include partition columns in WHERE clauses for partition pruning — e.g., `WHERE etr_y = '2025' AND etr_ym = '202503'` will skip scanning irrelevant partitions. Given the table's ~11B rows, partition pruning is critical for any practical query. The partition columns are Databricks-layer additions not present in the Synapse source. Deletion vectors are enabled (`delta.enableDeletionVectors = true`).

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| All logins for a customer | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 14 AND RealCID = @cid` |
| Position opens in a date range | `WHERE ActionTypeID IN (1,2,3) AND DateID BETWEEN @start AND @end` |
| Revenue (commissions) | `WHERE ActionTypeID IN (1,2,3,4,5,6,28) AND Commission > 0` |
| Deposits for a customer | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 7 AND RealCID = @cid` |
| Overnight fees | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 35 AND IsFeeDividend = 1` |
| Dividend payments | `WHERE ActionTypeID = 35 AND IsFeeDividend = 2` |
| First-time deposits (FTD) | `WHERE IsFTD = 1` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_ActionType` | `ON fca.ActionTypeID = dat.ActionTypeID` | Action type name and category |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer` | `ON fca.RealCID = dc.RealCID` | Customer demographics, country |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Instrument` | `ON fca.InstrumentID = di.InstrumentID` | Instrument name (position events only) |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Position` | `ON fca.PositionID = dp.PositionID` | Full position details (avoid when possible — heavy join on 11B rows) |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_BonusType` | `ON fca.BonusTypeID = dbt.BonusTypeID` | Bonus type name, IsWithdrawable (bonus events only) |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Campaign` | `ON fca.CampaignID = dcm.CampaignID` | Campaign code, description, dates |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Country` | `ON fca.CountryIDByIP = dco.CountryID` | Country name from IP geolocation |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_FundingType` | `ON fca.FundingTypeID = dft.FundingTypeID` | Payment method name (deposit/cashout events) |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_PaymentStatus` | `ON fca.PaymentStatusID = dps.PaymentStatusID` | Payment status name |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Product` | `ON fca.PlatformID = dp.ProductID` | Product, Platform, SubPlatform (logins/registrations only) |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Date` | `ON fca.DateID = dd.DateID` | Calendar attributes |
| `DWH_dbo.Dim_Regulation` | `ON fca.RegulationIDOnOpen = dr.ID` | Regulation name |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **Most columns are only populated for specific ActionTypeIDs.** InstrumentID, Leverage, Commission, IsBuy are all 0/NULL for logins, deposits, social events, etc.
- **11 billion rows** — always filter by ActionTypeID + DateID to avoid full scans
- **IsReal is always 1** in this table — it only contains real-account actions (no demo)
- **Leverage=0 means non-position event**, not "no leverage". For actual position opens, Leverage=1 means no leverage (real ownership)
- **IsBuy NULL** means non-position event. For position events: True=Buy, False=Sell
- **Description is sparse** — only populated for fee events (ActionTypeID=35) and a few others. Contains human-readable strings like "Over night fee", "Payment caused by dividend", "OpenTotalFees"
- **PlatformTypeID** vs **PlatformID**: PlatformTypeID is a legacy field (0=default, 99=STS); PlatformID is a FK to `Dim_Product.ProductID` (badly named — always JOIN to Dim_Product, don't hard-code values)
- **StatusID is nearly always 1** (~11B rows with StatusID=1, ~2M NULL)
- **DemoCID is always 0** (real accounts only)
- **HistoryID is NOT unique** — despite being intended as a key, it contains duplicates. Never use it for JOINs, deduplication, or row identification

## 1. Business Meaning

`Dim_Customer` is the DWH's central customer master table — the single point of reference for all customer attributes in analytics and reporting. It consolidates data from 14+ production staging tables spanning multiple microservices (Customer, BackOffice, Billing, Compliance, STS Audit, UserAPI, SalesForce, ContactVerification) into one denormalized row per customer.

The table follows a Type 1 SCD (Slowly Changing Dimension) pattern: each daily ETL run detects changes across 50+ columns and performs a DELETE/INSERT for modified customers, preserving certain indicator fields (deposit history, avatar, document proofs, Tangany/DLT/EquiLend IDs) that are maintained independently of the core change cycle.

Two UC copies exist:
- **Masked**: `main.dwh.gold_...dim_customer_masked` — PII columns contain masked values, accessible to general analytics
- **Unmasked**: `main.pii_data.gold_...dim_customer` — full PII, restricted access

### Business Usage

- **Regulatory Reporting**: Confluence "Business & Regulatory Undertakings Monitoring Platform" JOINs `Dim_Customer` on CID=RealCID for country, regulation, and status filtering
- **BI Queries**: Nearly every DWH fact table JOINs to Dim_Customer (via CID=RealCID) for customer segmentation
- **Synapse Training**: Confluence "Temporary Tables in Synapse" uses Dim_Customer as a reference example for HASH distribution optimization

### 2.2 ETL Pipeline (SP_Dim_Customer_DL_To_Synapse → SP_Dim_Customer)

```
ORCHESTRATOR (SP_Dim_Customer_DL_To_Synapse):
  1. Load 14 staging/external tables:
     Ext_Dim_Customer_Affiliate, Ext_Dim_Customer_BOCustomer, Ext_Dim_Customer_2FA,
     Ext_Dim_Customer_PhoneCustomer, Ext_Dim_Customer_Customer, Ext_Dim_Customer_Avatars,

     Ext_Dim_CustomerStatic, Ext_Dim_Customer_CustomerIdentification, Ext_Dim_Customer_StocksLending
  2. EXEC SP_Dim_Customer

CORE LOGIC (SP_Dim_Customer):
  Step 1: Build #customer — JOIN Ext_Customer_Customer + Ext_BOCustomer
          Compute: IsValidCustomer, IsCreditReportValidCB
          Rename: SerialID→AffiliateID, ManagerID→AccountManagerID, isEmployeeAccount→EmployeeAccount
  Step 2: Detect #new (CIDs not yet in Dim_Customer)
  Step 3: Detect #update (50+ column comparison using ISNULL + COLLATE)
  Step 4: Build #full_list (new OR updated CIDs) with 2FA from Ext_2FA
  Step 5: Preserve #CustomerInitalIndicaton (deposit, avatar, document, Tangany, DLT, phone, FTD fields)
  Step 6: BEGIN TRAN: DELETE matching CIDs → INSERT with preserved indicators
  Step 7: Post-transaction UPDATEs:
          Avatar → HasAvatar, AvatarUploadDate
          Deposit → IsDepositor, FirstDepositDate, FirstDepositAmount, FTD fields
          ScreeningStatusID → from screening service
          SalesForceAccountID → from SF ID map
          Document proofs → IsAddressProof, IsIDProof + expiry dates
          2FA → from audit log
          SubChannelID → from affiliate mapping
          ApexID → from CustomerStatic
          Phone → PhoneNumber, IsPhoneVerified, PhoneVerificationDate
          Tangany → TanganyID, TanganyStatusID
          DLT → DltID, DltStatusID
          StocksLending → EquiLendID, StocksLendingStatusID
  Step 8: Populate Ext_Dim_Customer_ExternalID_GCID, update UserName_Lower
```

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 4.1 Change Detection (CDC-Style)

The SP compares 50+ columns between `#customer` (staging) and existing `Dim_Customer` using `ISNULL(old,0) <> ISNULL(new,0)` with explicit `COLLATE Latin1_General_100_BIN` for string columns. Only customers with actual changes (or new customers) are processed. This prevents unnecessary row churn.

### 4.2 Indicator Preservation

When a customer row is updated (DELETE+INSERT), certain indicator fields are preserved from the old row via `#CustomerInitalIndicaton`: FirstDepositAmount, FirstDepositDate, HasAvatar, IsDepositor, ScreeningStatusID, SalesForceAccountID, document proofs, WorldCheckID, Tangany, Phone, EquiLend, DLT, FTD fields. These are then refreshed in subsequent post-load UPDATEs if new data is available.

### 4.3 Multi-Source Identity Resolution

Customer attributes come from multiple microservices. The ETL uses `ISNULL(history_version, current_value)` patterns to prefer the latest History version (with temporal filtering: ValidFrom < @CurrentDate, ValidFrom >= @DelayDate, ValidTo >= @CurrentDate) over the current snapshot, ensuring the most up-to-date attribute values are captured.

### 4.4 FTD Recovery Date Logic

The `FirstDepositDate` is updated using: if the existing `FirstDepositDate` (as date) is earlier than `FTDRecoveryDate`, use `FTDRecoveryDate`; otherwise use the `FTDDate`. This handles cases where an FTD was reversed and re-deposited on a different day.

### 4.5 IsValidCustomer Business Rule

```
IsValidCustomer = 1 WHEN:
  PlayerLevelID ≠ 4 (not Popular Investor)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (30, 26) (not bonus-only or specific label)
  AND CountryID ≠ 250
```

This excludes demo-like, internal, and specific-jurisdiction accounts from standard reporting.

## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Dim_PaymentStatus` is the lookup table for payment/deposit transaction status codes on the eToro platform. Every deposit or funding transaction carries a PaymentStatusID that identifies where in the payment lifecycle it is, or how it was resolved.

The 40 statuses span 6 functional categories:

| Category | IDs | Examples |
|----------|-----|---------|
| **Active/Pending** | 1, 4, 5, 13, 36 | New, Technical, InProcess, Pending, PendingReview |
| **Success** | 2, 7 | Approved, Confirmed |
| **Generic Decline** | 3, 31-35 | Decline, DeclineBinConflictCountry, DeclineSecurityValidation |
| **Block-based Decline** | 8-12, 14-24, 28-29 | DeclineBlockCard, DeclinedBlockedPayPal, DeclinedBlockedCountry |
| **Chargeback/Refund** | 11, 12, 25-27, 37-39 | Chargeback, Refund, ChargebackReversal, MigratedToDepositTable |
| **Cancellation** | 6 | Canceled |

PaymentStatusID=-1 is a DWH null-sentinel (manually inserted, UpdateDate at midnight vs. 02:12 for SP-loaded rows). PaymentStatusIDs 1-39 are loaded from `etoro_Dictionary_PaymentStatus` by `SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse`.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Payment Status Lifecycle

**What**: A payment transaction moves through statuses as it is processed. The final status determines the financial outcome.

**Standard flow**:
```
New (1) -> InProcess (5) -> [Approved (2) | Confirmed (7)]
        or -> Technical (4) [processing issue, may retry]
        or -> Pending (13) / PendingReview (36)
        or -> Decline (3) / Declined* (8-24, 28-35)
        or -> Canceled (6)
```

**Post-settlement flows**:
```
Approved/Confirmed -> Chargeback (11) -> ChargebackReversal (37)
                   -> Refund (12) -> RefundReversal (38)
                   -> RefundAsChargeback (26)
                   -> ReversedDeposit (39)
```

### 2.2 Decline Status Taxonomy

**What**: Most decline statuses encode the specific reason for rejection, which is valuable for fraud analytics and payment operations.

**Rules**:
- **Method-specific blocks** (14-24, 28): `DeclinedBlockedPayPal`, `DeclinedBlockedNeteller`, `DeclinedBlockedMoneyBookers`, `DeclinedBlockedWebMoney`, `DeclinedBlockedGiropay`, `DeclinedBlockedELV`, `DeclinedBlockedDirect24`, `DeclinedBlockedSofort` -- the customer's specific payment method is blocked by eToro's risk rules.
- **Country blocks** (18, 29, 34): `DeclinedBlockedCountry`, `DeclinedDepositCountryConflict`, `DeclineHighRiskCountry` -- blocked due to regulatory or risk reasons related to the customer's country.
- **Limit blocks** (10, 20, 30): `DeclineMemberLimits`, `DeclinedOverTheLimit`, `DeclinedOverTheLimitSingleDeposit` -- deposit exceeds the customer's allowed limits.
- **Fraud/risk** (9, 19, 31, 32, 35): `DeclineBadBins`, `DeclinedHighRiskCID`, `DeclineBinConflictCountry`, `DeclineSecurityValidation`, `DeclineByRRE` -- flagged by fraud or risk systems.
- **FTD limit** (33): `DeclineFtdOverTheLimit` -- first-time deposit exceeds allowed amount.

### 2.3 PaymentStatusID=-1 Sentinel

**Rule**: PaymentStatusID=-1 (Name='N/A') is a manually-inserted sentinel row. Its UpdateDate is `2026-03-11 00:00:00` (midnight), compared to `02:12` for SP-loaded rows. `DWHPaymentStatusID=0` for this row (vs. `PaymentStatusID` for all others). Always filter `WHERE PaymentStatusID > 0` for real status analysis.

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Successful deposits | `WHERE PaymentStatusID IN (2, 7)` |
| All declined payments | `WHERE Name LIKE 'Decline%' OR Name LIKE 'Declined%'` or `WHERE PaymentStatusID IN (3, 8, 9, 10, 14-24, 28-35)` |
| Payments in progress | `WHERE PaymentStatusID IN (1, 4, 5, 13, 36)` |
| Chargebacks and refunds | `WHERE PaymentStatusID IN (11, 12, 26, 37, 38, 39)` |
| Exclude sentinel | `WHERE PaymentStatusID > 0` (or `<> -1`) |

### 3.2 Gotchas

- **PaymentStatusID=-1 has DWHPaymentStatusID=0**: Anomaly -- the -1 row was manually inserted (not by SP_Dictionaries) and has DWHPaymentStatusID=0 instead of -1. Indicates this is a special-case sentinel.
- **UpdateDate is GETDATE() at load**: Does not reflect production modification date.
- **Method-blocked declines reference legacy payment methods**: `DeclinedBlockedMoneyBookers`, `DeclinedBlockedGiropay`, `DeclinedBlockedELV`, `DeclinedBlockedDirect24`, `DeclinedBlockedSofort` -- some of these payment methods may no longer be active on the platform.

## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Dim_Label` is a reference dictionary for eToro's white-label broker network -- the companies that licensed the eToro platform to offer it under their own brand to customers in specific regions. Each row maps a LabelID to a brand name (e.g., `RetailFX`, `ICMarkets`, `eToroUSA`, `Euroforex`). The label identifies which white-label channel a customer account originated from or is associated with.

The table has 26 rows. Most entries represent historical white-label partners from eToro's early expansion phase (2010-2015), when the platform was licensed to regional brokers. Some remain active (e.g., `eToroUSA`, `eToroChina`); others (e.g., `JCLyons`, `BT`, `Trend-Online`) are legacy brands that are no longer active. LabelID 0 (`eToro`) and LabelID 1 (`eToro`) are both the core eToro brand -- the distinction between 0 and 1 is a legacy artifact.

ETL is part of the bulk `SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse` stored procedure (runs daily). Source is `DWH_staging.etoro_Dictionary_Label`, which is loaded from the Generic Pipeline Bronze export of the production `Dictionary.Label` table.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 White-Label Brand Identification

**What**: Each customer account in the DWH has an associated LabelID identifying the broker brand under which they were onboarded.

**Rules**:
- LabelID=0 and LabelID=1 both map to `eToro` -- legacy dual-entry. Use `IN (0, 1)` or join to Name for eToro's own customers.
- Most white-label partners (LabelID 2-31) represent historical licensee brands. Many are no longer actively onboarding customers.
- `eToroUSA` (LabelID=14), `eToroRussia` (LabelID=29), `eToroChina` (LabelID=31) are eToro's own regional sub-brands.
- `eToro-Partners` (LabelID=27), `etoro-raf` (LabelID=28) may represent internal partner/referral channels.
- `Dealing` (LabelID=30) likely represents accounts assigned to the dealing desk.

### 2.2 DWHLabelID Redundancy

**What**: `DWHLabelID` is always equal to `LabelID` -- a standard DWH denormalization pattern seen across all Dim tables.

**Rule**: `DWHLabelID = LabelID` (from SP: `[LabelID] as [DWHLabelID]`). Do not use DWHLabelID for JOINs; use LabelID.

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

REPLICATE-distributed (26 rows fit trivially on every node). CLUSTERED INDEX on LabelID. Zero JOIN overhead when joining to fact tables on LabelID.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Get label name for customer account | `JOIN Dim_Label ON LabelID; SELECT Name` |
| Find all eToro-brand accounts | `WHERE LabelID IN (0, 1, 14, 29, 31)` (eToro core + regional sub-brands) |
| Segment by white-label vs eToro-direct | `WHERE LabelID BETWEEN 2 AND 13` (legacy white-label partners) |

### 3.3 Gotchas

- **LabelID 0 and 1 both = eToro**: Use `IN (0, 1)` or `Name = 'eToro'` for the core eToro brand.
- **StatusID is always 1**: ETL hardcodes StatusID=1 for all rows. Not a meaningful filter.
- **UpdateDate/InsertDate are both GETDATE()**: ETL timestamps from the daily load, not production modification dates.
- **Legacy brands**: Most non-eToro labels are historical. Volume in fact tables for these LabelIDs will be concentrated in earlier years.

## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Dim_VerificationLevel` defines the progressive identity verification tiers that eToro customers pass through as they complete KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements. Each level represents a milestone unlocking additional platform capabilities. Level 0 is the starting state (unverified); Level 3 is full KYC with unrestricted access.

Without this table, the DWH cannot segment customers by identity verification status. Regulatory requirements (MiFID II, ASIC, CySEC) mandate that large withdrawals, leveraged trading, and real stock purchases require minimum verification thresholds. This dimension provides the classification system for those segments in DWH analytics.

Source: `etoro.Dictionary.VerificationLevel` on etoroDB-REAL. Loaded by SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse with TRUNCATE + INSERT. Two DWH-specific additions beyond the source data:
1. `DWHVerificationLevelID` — populated as a copy of `ID` (passthrough alias used in DWH ETL)
2. `StatusID` — hardcoded to 1 for all rows (ETL active-row convention)
3. An ID=-1 sentinel row is inserted after the main load for NULL-safe JOINs in fact tables

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Progressive Verification Tiers

**What**: Four levels from unverified to fully KYC-verified, each unlocking more platform features.

**Columns Involved**: `ID`, `Name`

**Rules**:
- Level 0 — baseline state after registration; severe restrictions on trading and withdrawals
- Level 1 — basic verification complete (e.g., email confirmed, basic questionnaire); limited trading allowed
- Level 2 — intermediate verification (POI document submitted or under review); moderate trading access
- Level 3 — full KYC (POI + POA confirmed); complete platform access: unlimited withdrawals, all instruments, leveraged trading, real stocks

**Diagram**:
```
Registration → Level 0 (Unverified)
                    |
              Email/basic verified
                    v
              Level 1 (Basic)
                    |
              POI submitted
                    v
              Level 2 (Intermediate)
                    |
              POI + POA confirmed
                    v
              Level 3 (Full KYC)
```

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

REPLICATE is optimal for this 6-row table (5 source rows + 1 sentinel). Zero data movement on JOINs. Clustered index on `ID` for point lookups.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Customer count by verification tier | JOIN Dim_Customer ON VerificationLevelID = ID |
| Fully KYC customers | Filter ID = 3 |
| Unverified customer share | Filter ID = 0 |

### 3.3 Gotchas

- **DWHVerificationLevelID is a duplicate of ID**: This column has the same value as `ID` for every row. It is a DWH ETL convention artifact, not a separate key
- **StatusID is always 1**: Hardcoded by ETL, carries no business meaning
- **ID=-1 sentinel**: Added by SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse for NULL-safe JOINs in fact tables. Not a real verification level

# DWH_dbo.Dim_PlayerLevel

> Lookup table defining the 7 eToro Club loyalty tiers (Bronze through Diamond plus Internal) with tier-specific cashout wait times and display sort order. NOTE: DWH drops the primary equity qualification thresholds (RealizedEquityFrom/To, DaysInRiskBeforeDowngrade) present in production.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_PlayerLevel defines the eToro Club loyalty program tiers that segment customers by their realized equity (account value). Each tier grants progressively better benefits: faster cashout processing, higher service priority, and dedicated account management. The tiers in ascending rank are: Bronze -> Silver -> Gold -> Platinum -> Platinum Plus -> Diamond, plus a special Internal tier for employee/test accounts.

The data originates from `etoro.Dictionary.PlayerLevel` on the etoroDB-REAL production SQL Server. The Generic Pipeline exports this table daily (Override strategy) to `Bronze/etoro/Dictionary/PlayerLevel/` in the data lake. Production has 7 active tier rows (IDs 1-7); DWH adds a synthetic ID=0 N/A placeholder.

**CRITICAL SCHEMA DRIFT**: The DWH ETL loads only 8 of the production's 13 columns. The following production columns are DROPPED and not available in DWH: `RealizedEquityFrom`, `RealizedEquityTo` (the primary tier qualification thresholds), `IsWalletRedeemAllowed`, `ThresholdPercentToCurrentLevel`, and `DaysInRiskBeforeDowngrade`. For tier qualification logic, query the upstream `etoro.Dictionary.PlayerLevel` directly or the upstream wiki. The DWH table is suitable only for resolving tier names and cashout hours -- not for equity-based tier evaluation.

Loaded by `SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse` via TRUNCATE + INSERT from staging, followed by a separate INSERT VALUES for the ID=0 N/A sentinel using `@ddate` (midnight timestamp). Refreshes daily.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Tier Hierarchy and Rank Order

**What**: Six customer-facing loyalty tiers plus one internal tier, ranked by realized equity.

**Columns Involved**: `PlayerLevelID`, `Name`, `Sort`

**Rules**:
- IDs are NOT in rank order -- use `Sort` column for display ordering.
- Sort order: 0=Internal (excluded), 1=Bronze, 2=Silver, 3=Gold, 4=Platinum, 5=Platinum Plus, 6=Diamond.
- Internal (ID=4) is excluded from customer-facing reports: `WHERE PlayerLevelID <> 4`.
- ID=0 (N/A) is a DWH-only ETL placeholder for NULL FK safety. Not in production.

**Diagram**:
```
Tier Hierarchy (by Sort/Rank):
  Sort 1 = Bronze     (ID=1) -- entry level
  Sort 2 = Silver     (ID=5)
  Sort 3 = Gold       (ID=3)
  Sort 4 = Platinum   (ID=2)
  Sort 5 = Platinum + (ID=6)
  Sort 6 = Diamond    (ID=7) -- top tier
  Sort 0 = Internal   (ID=4) -- excluded
  (ID=0  = N/A       -- DWH ETL placeholder)
```

### 2.2 Cashout Processing Speed by Tier

**What**: Higher tiers receive priority cashout processing as a loyalty benefit.

**Columns Involved**: `CashoutPendingHours`

**Rules**:
- **120 hours (5 days)**: Bronze (1), Silver (5), Internal (4), N/A (0)
- **72 hours (3 days)**: Gold (3)
- **24 hours (1 day)**: Platinum (2), Platinum Plus (6), Diamond (7)
- This is one of the most impactful benefits of upper tier membership.

### 2.3 Legacy Lot/Deposit Thresholds (Deprecated)

**What**: Historical tier qualification fields -- superseded by RealizedEquity (not in DWH).

**Columns Involved**: `FromSumLotCount`, `ToSumLotCount`, `FromSumDeposit`, `ToSumDeposit`

**Rules**:
- All set to `-1` for Platinum (2), Platinum Plus (6), Diamond (7) -- meaning "disabled/not applicable".
- Bronze (1) has 1-3000 lots, $0-$999 deposit; Silver (5) has 3001-20000 lots, $1000-$4999; Gold (3) has 20001-100000 lots, $5000-$19999.
- These columns are legacy artifacts. The current tier system uses `RealizedEquityFrom/To` which are NOT loaded into DWH.
- Value -1 = "threshold disabled -- upper tier, equity-based qualification only".

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with a HEAP index. HEAP (no clustering) is unusual for dimension tables -- most Dim_ tables use CLUSTERED INDEX. With only 8 rows, HEAP is not a concern for performance but means scans are unordered. Always use `ORDER BY Sort` for consistent tier display.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, this table lands as `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_playerlevel`. With 8 rows, no partitioning or Z-ORDER is needed.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |

| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer | ON fsc.PlayerLevelID = dpl.PlayerLevelID | Tier in daily snapshots |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **IDs are NOT in rank order**: PlayerLevelID 2=Platinum, 3=Gold, 5=Silver. Always use `Sort` for ordering tiers. Filtering `PlayerLevelID > 3` does NOT mean "higher than Gold".
- **Internal tier (ID=4)**: Must be excluded in most customer analytics: `WHERE PlayerLevelID <> 4` or `WHERE PlayerLevelID NOT IN (0, 4)`.
- **-1 in range columns means disabled**: For Platinum/Platinum Plus/Diamond, FromSumLotCount=-1 and ToSumLotCount=-1 indicate the legacy lot-count threshold is not used. Do NOT interpret -1 as a valid lot count.
- **Critical columns missing from DWH**: `RealizedEquityFrom`, `RealizedEquityTo`, `DaysInRiskBeforeDowngrade`, `ThresholdPercentToCurrentLevel`, and `IsWalletRedeemAllowed` are ALL in production but NOT in DWH. For equity-tier evaluation, use the upstream source.
- **HEAP index**: Unlike most DWH Dim_ tables, this uses HEAP (no CCI). Row order is not guaranteed without explicit ORDER BY.
- **ID=0 midnight timestamp**: The N/A placeholder (ID=0) has midnight InsertDate/UpdateDate from `@ddate = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)`, while production rows have full timestamps from GETDATE().

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_PlayerStatus defines 16 distinct account restriction states in the eToro platform, each encoding a granular permission matrix controlling what a user can and cannot do. Unlike Dim_AccountStatus (binary open/closed), PlayerStatus provides fine-grained control over trading, deposits, withdrawals, social features, and copy-trading. This enables compliance and fraud teams to surgically restrict specific capabilities without full account lockout.

The data originates from `etoro.Dictionary.PlayerStatus` on the etoroDB-REAL production SQL Server. The Generic Pipeline exports this table daily (Override) to the data lake, and `SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse` loads it via TRUNCATE + INSERT, plus a separate sentinel INSERT for ID=0 (N/A placeholder). The ETL adds 4 computed columns (DWHPlayerStatusID, StatusID, UpdateDate, InsertDate) and **drops 2 production columns** (`CanCopy` and `GetsInterest`).

PlayerStatusID is stored in Dim_Customer and is read by virtually every user-facing operation -- login, trading, funding, social posting, and copy-trading -- to enforce permission checks. The permission flags are queried directly from this table rather than hardcoded in business logic.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Permission Matrix System

**What**: Each player status defines a complete set of boolean permissions that gate platform features.

**Columns Involved**: `IsBlocked`, `CanEditPosition`, `CanOpenPosition`, `CanClosePosition`, `CanDeposit`, `CanRequestWithdraw`, `CanLogin`, `CanChatAndPost`, `CanBeCopied`

**Rules**:
- **Full Block** (IsBlocked=1): IDs 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 14 -- user cannot log in. All capabilities disabled.
- **Partial Restriction**: IDs 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 -- user can access some features but not others.
- **Full Access**: IDs 1, 5 -- all capabilities enabled. ID=5 (Warning) is identical to Normal in permissions but signals compliance flagging.
- **Close-Only / Wind-Down**: IDs 9 (Trade & MIMO Blocked) and 15 (Block Deposit & Trading) -- user can close existing positions and log in, but cannot open new positions or deposit.

**Diagram**:
```
Access Level Summary:
  ID=1  Normal                -- All capabilities ON
  ID=5  Warning               -- All ON + compliance flag
  ID=3  Chat Blocked          -- All ON except CanChatAndPost
  ID=10 Deposit Blocked       -- All ON except CanDeposit
  ID=12 Copy Block            -- All ON except CanBeCopied (note: DWH lacks CanCopy col)
  ID=9  Trade & MIMO Blocked  -- Close+Login only; no open/deposit/withdraw
  ID=13 Pending Verification  -- Close+Login only
  ID=15 Block Deposit&Trading -- Close+Login+Chat+Copy; no open/deposit
  ID=11 Social Index          -- All ON except CanDeposit + CanRequestWithdraw
  ID=2  Blocked               -- ALL OFF (full lockout, cannot login)
  ID=4  Blocked Upon Request  -- ALL OFF (self-requested lockout)
  ID=6  Under Investigation   -- ALL OFF (compliance hold)
  ID=7  Scalpers Block        -- ALL OFF (trading abuse)
  ID=8  PayPal Investigation  -- ALL OFF (payment fraud)
  ID=14 Failed Verification   -- ALL OFF (KYC failure)
  ID=0  N/A                   -- All OFF (DWH ETL placeholder)
```

### 2.2 Status Transition Patterns

**What**: Common pathways between player statuses driven by compliance, fraud, and user lifecycle events.

**Columns Involved**: `PlayerStatusID`

**Rules**:
- New accounts: 1 (Normal) or 13 (Pending Verification) depending on regulation
- Compliance investigation: 1 -> 6 (Under Investigation) -> 1 (cleared) or 2 (blocked)
- KYC timeout: 13 (Pending) -> 14 (Failed Verification) if docs not submitted
- Self-service closure: 1 -> 4 (Blocked Upon Request)
- Scalping detection: 1 -> 7 (Scalpers Block)
- PayPal fraud: 1 -> 8 (PayPal Investigation)
- Wind-down: 1 -> 9 or 15 (close-only mode for accounts under investigation)

### 2.3 Schema Drift -- Dropped Production Columns

**What**: Two production permission columns are not loaded into DWH.

**Dropped**:
- `CanCopy` (bit, default 1) -- whether user can copy other traders. Status 12 (Copy Block) sets this to 0.
- `GetsInterest` (bit) -- whether overnight fees/credits apply to user's positions. NOT available in DWH.

**Impact**: Analysts cannot determine from DWH whether a given status blocks copy-trading (CanCopy) or overnight interest (GetsInterest). For these, query production or the upstream wiki.

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with a HEAP index. HEAP means no CCI/sort -- for 16 rows this is irrelevant to performance, but row order is arbitrary without ORDER BY. Always join on `PlayerStatusID`. With REPLICATE, JOINs are zero-cost (all nodes have a full copy).

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, no partitioning needed. Full scan of 16 rows is trivial.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resolve a PlayerStatusID to a name | JOIN Dim_PlayerStatus ON PlayerStatusID |
| Find customers who cannot trade | JOIN Dim_Customer, filter CanOpenPosition = 0 or IsBlocked = 1 |
| Count customers by restriction category | GROUP BY IsBlocked + CanOpenPosition combination |
| Find wind-down accounts (close-only) | Filter CanClosePosition = 1 AND CanOpenPosition = 0 |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON dc.PlayerStatusID = dps.PlayerStatusID | Resolve status name and permission flags per customer |
| DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer | ON vdc.PlayerStatusID = dps.PlayerStatusID | View-level status resolution |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer | ON fsc.PlayerStatusID = dps.PlayerStatusID | Customer status in daily snapshots |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **HEAP index**: Like Dim_PlayerLevel, this table uses HEAP. No guaranteed row order without ORDER BY.
- **ID=0 sentinel**: All permission bits are 0 for ID=0 (N/A). LEFT JOIN if the fact table may have NULL or missing PlayerStatusID.
- **CanCopy and GetsInterest are MISSING**: These two production columns are not in DWH. Analysts needing copy-block or interest-eligibility logic must use production data.
- **Status 5 (Warning) = same permissions as Status 1 (Normal)**: All permission flags are identical. The only difference is the compliance signal encoded in the ID itself.
- **Status names have trailing spaces**: Live data shows "Blocked" with trailing whitespace for some status names (e.g., Name column for ID=2). Apply RTRIM() in comparisons if matching by name string.

## 1. Business Meaning

`Dim_FundingType` is a payment method dimension with 44 rows (FundingTypeID 0-44, with ID 41 absent). Each row represents a payment method or funding channel that eToro customers use for deposits and withdrawals. Methods span credit cards, bank transfers, e-wallets, crypto, regional payment systems (Yandex, Qiwi, AliPay, WeChat, Przelewy24), and eToro-internal channels (eToroCryptoWallet, eToroMoney).

Three behavioral flags classify each method:
- `IsNewStyle`: modern-era payment integration (True = post-legacy platform)
- `IsSingleFunding`: one-time/single use (True = e.g., BankDraft, InternalPayment)
- `IsCashoutActive`: cashout/withdrawal supported via this method (True = bidirectional)

**FundingTypeID=0 (N/A)** is a DWH-injected synthetic null-sentinel row, inserted after the main staging load as a hardcoded VALUES insert. Fact tables use `ISNULL(FundingTypeID, 0)` to replace NULLs with this sentinel, enabling NULL-safe joins.

**FundingTypeID=27 (eToroCryptoWallet)** has hardcoded business logic: `SP_Fact_CustomerAction` calculates `IsRedeem = 1` when CreditTypeID=2 AND FundingTypeID=27. This hardcoding creates a maintenance risk if the crypto wallet ID changes.

This dimension is actively consumed by three major fact tables: `Fact_BillingDeposit`, `Fact_BillingWithdraw`, and `Fact_CustomerAction`.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Payment Method Classification Flags

**What**: Three bit flags classify payment method behavior.

**Columns Involved**: `IsNewStyle`, `IsSingleFunding`, `IsCashoutActive`

**Rules**:
- `IsNewStyle`: FALSE only for BankDraft (4), WesternUnion (5), MoneyGram (9). These are legacy payment methods.
- `IsSingleFunding`: TRUE for one-time or non-reusable methods: BankDraft (4), WesternUnion (5), MoneyGram (9), InternalPayment (16), TestDeposit (18), IBDeposit (19)
- `IsCashoutActive`: FALSE for methods where withdrawal is not supported: Giropay (11), Payoneer (14), Sofort (15), InternalPayment (16), LocalBankWire (17), TestDeposit (18), CashU (24), AliPay (25), WeChat (26), RapidTransfer (30), AstroPay (31), EtoroOptions (42), MoneyFarm (44)

### 2.2 Null Sentinel (FundingTypeID=0)

**What**: FundingTypeID=0 / Name='N/A' is a synthetic row added post-staging to represent unknown/missing funding type.

**Columns Involved**: `FundingTypeID`, `DWHFundingTypeID`

**Rules**:
- SP_Fact_CustomerAction uses `ISNULL(FundingTypeID, 0)` and `ISNULL(d.FundingTypeID, ISNULL(dd.FundingTypeID, 0))` to coerce NULLs to 0
- For the N/A row: DWHFundingTypeID=0 (same as FundingTypeID), all flags=False
- Inserted via hardcoded VALUES block in SP_Dictionaries (not from staging)

### 2.3 eToroCryptoWallet Hardcoded Logic

**What**: FundingTypeID=27 (eToroCryptoWallet) drives the `IsRedeem` flag in Fact_CustomerAction.

**Columns Involved**: `FundingTypeID`

**Rules**:
- `IsRedeem = CASE WHEN CreditTypeID = 2 AND FundingTypeID = 27 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END`
- This hardcoded check appears in multiple sections of SP_Fact_CustomerAction
- Risk: If eToroCryptoWallet is assigned a new FundingTypeID, IsRedeem calculation breaks silently

### 2.4 DWHFundingTypeID Passthrough

**What**: `DWHFundingTypeID` mirrors `FundingTypeID` for all source rows (passthrough from staging).

**Rules**:
- For rows from staging: `DWHFundingTypeID = FundingTypeID` (same value, ETL SET `[FundingTypeID] as [DWHFundingTypeID]`)
- For the N/A row (FundingTypeID=0): `DWHFundingTypeID = 0`
- Purpose is likely for DWH-layer remapping or future surrogate key substitution. Currently identical to FundingTypeID.

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, REPLICATE-distributed (44 rows - appropriate). CLUSTERED INDEX on FundingTypeID. No data movement on joins.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, 44 rows - no partitioning needed. Broadcast join automatic.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Decode FundingTypeID to name | `LEFT JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_FundingType ON FundingTypeID` |
| Find cashout-eligible methods | `WHERE IsCashoutActive = 1` |
| Identify legacy payment methods | `WHERE IsNewStyle = 0` |
| Exclude N/A sentinel | `WHERE FundingTypeID > 0` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Fact_BillingDeposit | ON FundingTypeID | Payment method for deposits |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_BillingWithdraw | ON FundingTypeID_Withdraw / FundingTypeID_Funding | Payment method for withdrawals |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_CustomerAction | ON FundingTypeID | Payment method for customer financial actions |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **FundingTypeID=0 is synthetic**: The N/A row (ID=0) does not come from the source system. It is DWH-injected after TRUNCATE+INSERT. Never filter it out blindly - fact tables use it for NULL FK rows.
- **FundingTypeID=41 missing**: The sequence jumps from 40 to 42. ID 41 was likely deleted or never assigned.
- **FundingTypeID=27 hardcoded**: eToroCryptoWallet ID is hardcoded in SP_Fact_CustomerAction for IsRedeem logic. Do not renumber/reassign this ID.
- **FundingTypeID is smallint NULL**: Nullable primary key with NOT NULL-equivalent usage. Join columns in fact tables may be int - implicit type conversion occurs.
- **Fact_BillingWithdraw has TWO FK columns**: `FundingTypeID_Withdraw` (the withdrawal method) and `FundingTypeID_Funding` (the original funding method). Both reference this dimension.

# DWH_dbo.Dim_Currency

> Despite its name, this is the universal instrument registry (15.7K rows) for all tradeable assets on the eToro platform: stocks (13K), ETFs (1.1K), crypto (686), commodities (533), indices (203), and forex (174).

## 1. Business Meaning

`Dim_Currency` is the **universal instrument registry** for the eToro DWH. Despite its misleading name (inherited from eToro's origins as a forex-only platform), it contains every tradeable asset on the platform: 13,044 stocks, 1,094 ETFs, 686 crypto assets, 533 commodities, 203 indices, and 174 forex pairs - 15,734 rows total as of 2026-03-11.

`CurrencyID` is the platform-wide instrument identifier. It is referenced by virtually every fact table in the DWH: trade positions, deposits, credit events, and cost history all use CurrencyID to identify the instrument involved. Joining to Dim_Currency decodes CurrencyID into instrument name, asset class (CurrencyTypeID), and trading properties.

The ETL is a full TRUNCATE+INSERT daily reload from `DWH_staging.etoro_Dictionary_Currency`. All 9 source columns are passthroughs; only UpdateDate is ETL-computed. The DWH has more rows than the upstream wiki documents (15.7K vs 10.7K upstream) because the wiki was written earlier and the platform has added more instruments since.

Upstream wiki: `DB_Schema/etoro/Wiki/Dictionary/Tables/Dictionary.Currency.md` (quality 9+/10, VERIFIED confidence).

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Instrument Classification by Asset Class

**What**: CurrencyTypeID classifies every instrument into one of 6 asset classes, determining trading rules, leverage limits, and settlement options.

**Columns Involved**: `CurrencyTypeID`

**DWH distribution (live 2026-03-11)**:
```
CurrencyTypeID=5 (Stocks):     13,044 rows (83%)
CurrencyTypeID=6 (ETF):         1,094 rows (7%)
CurrencyTypeID=10 (Crypto):       686 rows (4%)
CurrencyTypeID=2 (Commodity):     533 rows (3%)
CurrencyTypeID=4 (Indices):       203 rows (1%)
CurrencyTypeID=1 (Forex):         174 rows (1%)
```

**Rules**:
- Stocks (5): Individual company shares. Can trade as REAL (1x) or CFD.
- ETF (6): Exchange-traded funds. Similar rules to stocks.
- Crypto (10): Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. ESMA max 2x retail leverage. Can be REAL at 1x.
- Commodity (2): Gold, Oil, Silver, etc. Always CFD. ESMA max 10x retail.
- Forex (1): Currency pairs. Always CFD. ESMA max 30x (majors) / 20x (minors).
- Indices (4): S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc. Always CFD. ESMA max 20x retail.

### 2.2 Bitmask System (Legacy Forex)

**What**: The Mask column encodes forex instrument identity as power-of-2 bitmasks for legacy system compatibility.

**Columns Involved**: `Mask`

**Rules**:
- USD=1 (2^0), EUR=2 (2^1), GBP=4 (2^2), JPY=8 (2^3), AUD=16 (2^4), CHF=32 (2^5), CAD=64 (2^6), NZD=128 (2^7)
- Only meaningful for the original 8 major forex currencies. Stocks, crypto, commodities have NULL or 0.
- Hard ceiling of 31 instruments (INT bitmask limit) - now exceeded, so not used for newer assets.

### 2.3 EEA Stock Exchange Compliance (MiFID II)

**What**: Flags instruments listed on European Economic Area exchanges requiring KID documents under PRIIPs regulation.

**Columns Involved**: `EEAStockExchange`

**Rules**:
- EEAStockExchange=1 for ~216 instruments on EU/EEA exchanges (London, Frankfurt, Paris, etc.)
- These require KID (Key Information Document) availability for retail EU clients
- Affects instrument availability for EU-regulated users

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, REPLICATE with 15.7K rows is appropriate. The CLUSTERED INDEX on CurrencyID supports fast point lookups. At this row count, the table is small enough to broadcast to all nodes efficiently.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, store as Delta (MANAGED), no partitioning needed (15.7K rows). Z-ORDER BY CurrencyID optional.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Decode instrument ID in a fact | `JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_Currency d ON f.CurrencyID = d.CurrencyID` |
| Filter stocks only | `WHERE CurrencyTypeID = 5` |
| Find a specific instrument by ticker | `WHERE Abbreviation = 'AAPL.US'` |
| List EEA instruments | `WHERE EEAStockExchange = 1` |
| Exclude CurrencyID=0 (placeholder) | `WHERE CurrencyID > 0` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| All DWH fact tables | ON f.CurrencyID = d.CurrencyID | Decode instrument for any trade/position/cost fact |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Country | ON c.DefaultCurrencyID = d.CurrencyID | Default account currency per country [UNVERIFIED - DefaultCurrencyID dropped from Dim_Country] |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **Naming is misleading**: This is NOT just currencies. 83% of rows are stocks. Always filter by CurrencyTypeID when intent is asset-class-specific.
- CurrencyID=0 is a placeholder ("NULL instrument"). Exclude with `WHERE CurrencyID > 0` for business analytics.
- Mask is NULL/0 for all non-forex instruments. Do not use Mask for asset identification outside legacy forex systems.
- DWH has 15.7K rows; upstream production wiki shows 10.7K - the platform has added ~5K instruments since the wiki was written. Row count grows over time.
- Name is `varchar(50)` - many stock names are verbose (e.g., "United States of America, US Dollar"). Use Abbreviation for tickers.

## 1. Business Meaning

`Dim_Country` is one of the most heavily-referenced dimension tables in the DWH. It defines every country and territory the eToro platform recognizes (251 rows: 250 active countries + 1 "Not available" placeholder at CountryID=0). Each row provides geographic classification, regulatory risk attributes, marketing segmentation, and compliance data for users registered from that country.

When a customer registers, their CountryID determines: which regulatory entity governs them (via RegulationID), what AML/KYC scrutiny level applies (IsHighRiskCountry, RiskGroupID), what marketing desk handles them (Desk), and whether they can receive RAF bonuses (IsEligibleForRAFBonusCountry).

The ETL is multi-step: TRUNCATE+INSERT from etoro.Dictionary.Country (primary, joined to etoro.Dictionary.MarketingRegion for the Region label), then three UPDATE passes that patch in EU classification from Ext_Dim_Country, Desk/CFKey from Ext_Dim_Country_Region_Desk, and RegulationID from ComplianceStateDB.Compliance.RegulationCountry. Several columns present in the upstream Dictionary.Country source are dropped in DWH (IsSettlementRestricted, DefaultCurrencyID, LanguageID, IsActive, PhonePrefix, IsoCode).

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 High-Risk Country Flag (Computed)

**What**: IsHighRiskCountry is derived from RiskGroupID in the ETL, not passed through from source. AML-flagged countries trigger enhanced due diligence.

**Columns Involved**: `IsHighRiskCountry`, `RiskGroupID`

**Rules**:
- `CASE WHEN RiskGroupID IN (0, 4) THEN 0 ELSE 1 END` -> IsHighRiskCountry
- RiskGroupID=0 (None): 70 countries -> not high risk
- RiskGroupID=4 (Verified before deposit): 2 countries -> not high risk
- RiskGroupID=1 (High risk country): 100 countries -> high risk
- RiskGroupID=2 (High risk for new clients): 71 countries -> high risk
- RiskGroupID=3 (High risk FATF country): 8 countries -> high risk
- High-risk countries trigger enhanced document verification, manual review of first deposit, and reduced transaction monitoring thresholds

**Diagram**:
```
RiskGroupID -> IsHighRiskCountry
0 (None)                  -> 0  (70 countries)
4 (Verified bfr deposit)  -> 0  (2 countries)
1 (High risk)             -> 1  (100 countries)
2 (High risk new clients) -> 1  (71 countries)
3 (High risk FATF)        -> 1  (8 countries)
```

### 2.2 EU vs. European Country Classification

**What**: Two separate flags distinguish full EU membership from broader European geography.

**Columns Involved**: `EU`, `IsEuropeanCountry`

**Rules**:
- EU=1: 27 countries with full EU membership (legal/treaty member states)
- IsEuropeanCountry=1: 66 countries total (27 EU members + 39 other European countries)
- Source: Ext_Dim_Country (manual extension table), not from etoro.Dictionary.Country
- EU=1 always implies IsEuropeanCountry=1. IsEuropeanCountry=1 does NOT imply EU=1.

### 2.3 Region vs. MarketingRegion

**What**: DWH exposes two separate geographic segmentations. `Region` is marketing-driven; the source geographic `RegionID` is dropped.

**Columns Involved**: `Region`, `MarketingRegionID`, `MarketingRegionManualName`, `Desk`

**Rules**:
- `Region` is loaded from etoro.Dictionary.MarketingRegion.Name (y.Name AS Region in SP). It is the marketing region label.
- `MarketingRegionManualName` is a manual override from Ext_Dim_Country - may differ from Region (e.g., Albania: Region=ROE, MarketingRegionManualName=CEE).
- `Desk` is a sales/support desk assignment from Ext_Dim_Country_Region_Desk, joined via MarketingRegionID.
- The upstream Dictionary.Country source has a geographic `RegionID` pointing to Dictionary.Region - this is NOT loaded to DWH.
- 22 distinct Region values in DWH (South & Central America=40, Africa=38, ROW=38, French=23, etc.)

### 2.4 Dropped Source Columns (Compliance-Critical)

**What**: Several compliance and localization columns present in the upstream source are NOT loaded to DWH.

**Dropped from etoro.Dictionary.Country**:
- `IsSettlementRestricted`: 21 countries restricted to CFD-only trading (cannot hold REAL assets). Includes United States (SEC/FINRA). CRITICAL for compliance analysts.
- `DefaultCurrencyID`: Trading account default currency (USD/EUR/GBP/AUD/CAD/PLN).
- `LanguageID`: UI language default.
- `IsActive`: Whether country is active on platform.
- `PhonePrefix`: International dialing code.
- `IsoCode`: ISO 3166-1 numeric code.
- `RegionID`: Geographic region FK (DWH replaces with text Region label from MarketingRegion).

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE (correct for a 251-row dimension - broadcast to all nodes avoids data movement on JOINs). HEAP means no sorted index. The non-clustered PK on CountryID is NOT ENFORCED - duplicates are theoretically possible but prevented by ETL TRUNCATE.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, store as Delta (MANAGED), no partitioning needed (251 rows). Z-ORDER on CountryID optional for join optimization.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Decode country for a customer | `JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_Country d ON f.CountryID = d.CountryID` |
| Filter high-risk countries | `WHERE d.IsHighRiskCountry = 1` |
| Filter EU customers | `WHERE d.EU = 1` |
| Group by marketing region | `GROUP BY d.Region` |
| Find regulation for a country | `SELECT RegulationID FROM Dim_Country WHERE CountryID = @id` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON c.CountryID = d.CountryID | Decode customer country attributes |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_BillingDeposit | ON f.CountryID = d.CountryID | Country-level deposit analytics |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_CountryBin | ON c.CountryID = d.CountryID | BIN-to-country card mapping |
| DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer | ON v.CountryID = d.CountryID | Customer view with country decode |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- CountryID=0 ("Not available") is a real row - use `WHERE CountryID > 0` to exclude the placeholder in population-level queries.
- `IsHighRiskCountry` is RECOMPUTED from `RiskGroupID` by the ETL (not passthrough from source). If source IsHighRiskCountry changes but RiskGroupID stays the same, DWH will not reflect the change.
- `IsSettlementRestricted` is NOT in DWH. This critical compliance flag must be looked up in the source etoro.Dictionary.Country if needed.
- `Region` reflects `MarketingRegion.Name`, not the geographic `Dictionary.Region`. The two segmentations differ (e.g., Albania: geographic region=Europe, marketing Region=ROE).
- `DWHCountryID` always equals `CountryID` (redundant copy from SP: `x.CountryID AS DWHCountryID`). Never use both in GROUP BY.
- `StatusID` is hardcoded to 1 for all rows (including CountryID=0). No meaningful variation.
- `InsertDate` and `UpdateDate` are both set to GETDATE() on each daily reload - they reflect ETL run time, not original insert or data change time.

## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Dim_Manager` is the reference table for eToro's BackOffice customer-success managers -- the people (support agents, account managers, team leaders) assigned to serve customer accounts. A customer account typically has an assigned ManagerID that identifies the primary relationship owner in the BackOffice/CRM system.

The table holds 5,152 rows: 1,367 currently active managers (`IsActive=True`) including 1 active team leader, plus 3,785 historical/departed managers (`IsActive=False`). Since rows are never deleted, the table preserves the full history of everyone who has ever been a manager in the system.

Key columns: `FirstName`, `LastName` (personal details), `IsActive` (currently employed/assigned), `IsTeamLeader` (hierarchy flag), `SFManagerID` (Salesforce CRM ID, 18-char), `CalendlyID` (scheduling link). The `UserGroup` and `ParentUserGroup` columns are **not populated** -- both are hardcoded to `'Not Available'` in the ETL SP.

ETL pattern: `SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse` -- loads a staging intermediate (`Ext_Dim_Manager`) from `DWH_staging.etoro_BackOffice_Manager`, then merges into `Dim_Manager` (UPDATE existing rows, INSERT new rows). A post-load UPDATE sets `SFManagerID` from the Salesforce-to-BackOffice mapping table.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Incremental Merge Pattern (Soft-Delete)

**What**: Unlike most DWH Dim tables that use TRUNCATE+INSERT, Dim_Manager uses an incremental UPDATE+INSERT pattern that preserves historical manager records.

**Rules**:
- **UPDATE**: Existing ManagerID rows are updated with current FirstName, LastName, IsTeamLeader, IsActive, CalendlyID. This means a manager's name, active status, or team-leader flag can change.
- **INSERT**: New ManagerIDs from `etoro_BackOffice_Manager` that do not exist in Dim_Manager are appended. `InsertDate` is set to GETDATE() on first insert only.
- **No DELETE**: Managers who leave the company remain in the table with `IsActive=False`. The table is the full history of all managers.
- **SFManagerID**: Set via a separate post-load UPDATE joining to `SalesForce_DB_Prod_dbo_SalesForceToBOManagerMapping`. Managers not in Salesforce have NULL SFManagerID.

### 2.2 UserGroup / ParentUserGroup Not Populated

**What**: The DDL defines `UserGroup` and `ParentUserGroup` columns, but the ETL hardcodes both to `'Not Available'` for all rows.

**Rule**: Do not use `UserGroup` or `ParentUserGroup` for any analysis. Both columns have the literal string `'Not Available'` for every row. The intended team/group hierarchy data has not been implemented.

### 2.3 CalendlyID for Customer Scheduling

**What**: `CalendlyID` holds the manager's Calendly scheduling account identifier, used for customer-facing meeting booking.

**Rule**: Most inactive (historical) managers have `CalendlyID='etoro-club'`, suggesting a default value is set when a manager leaves the system rather than the CalendlyID being set to NULL. Active managers have their personal Calendly IDs. Do not use CalendlyID to infer active status.

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

REPLICATE-distributed (5,152 rows trivially replicated). HEAP -- no clustered index. PK_ManagerID is NOT ENFORCED (Synapse syntax; uniqueness is not guaranteed at the DB level, though duplicates are not expected). Zero JOIN overhead.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Get manager name for a customer account | `JOIN Dim_Manager ON ManagerID; SELECT FirstName, LastName` |
| Find all currently active managers | `WHERE IsActive = 1` (1,367 rows) |
| Find active team leaders | `WHERE IsActive = 1 AND IsTeamLeader = 1` (1 row currently) |
| Cross-reference with Salesforce | `WHERE SFManagerID IS NOT NULL` |

### 3.3 Gotchas

- **UserGroup = 'Not Available'**: Both `UserGroup` and `ParentUserGroup` are hardcoded placeholder strings. Do not use for grouping or filtering.
- **3,785 inactive managers**: Always filter `WHERE IsActive = 1` for current-state analysis. Leaving out this filter inflates manager counts 4x.
- **CalendlyID default 'etoro-club'**: This is a default value for departed/inactive managers, not a real Calendly account. Filter on IsActive=1 for meaningful CalendlyID usage.
- **HEAP index**: Full table scans on all queries. Acceptable at 5,152 rows.
- **PK NOT ENFORCED**: No database-level guarantee against duplicate ManagerIDs. Validate if using ManagerID as a join key in data quality checks.
- **SFManagerID is NULL for many managers**: Only managers that appear in the Salesforce-to-BackOffice mapping have SFManagerID populated.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_BillingDepot is the DWH version of etoro.Billing.Depot -- the central payment gateway routing configuration table. Each row defines one payment depot: a named combination of payment method (FundingTypeID), payment direction (PaymentTypeID: Deposit/Cashout/Refund), and processing gateway (ProtocolID). The routing engine selects a depot to process each transaction based on these three dimensions plus customer-specific factors (regulation, BIN, quotas).

Source: etoro.Billing.Depot on etoroDB-REAL. The production table is exported daily to Bronze/etoro/Billing/Depot/ and staged into DWH_staging.etoro_Billing_Depot. SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse loads from that staging table using a TRUNCATE + INSERT pattern.

163 rows total (DepotID range 1-174 with gaps); 114 active (70%), 49 inactive (legacy or decommissioned). The DWH includes only 7 of the 8 production columns -- PayoutGeneration and Features are excluded by the ETL SELECT.

Sample depots: 1=MoneyBookers USD, 7=Neteller, 10=Wire, 3=WebMoney, 4=Giropay.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Depot Routing Selection

**What**: The payment routing engine selects a depot for each transaction based on FundingTypeID, PaymentTypeID, and ProtocolID combined with customer-specific routing criteria.

**Columns Involved**: `DepotID`, `FundingTypeID`, `PaymentTypeID`, `ProtocolID`, `IsActive`

**Rules**:
- Only depots with IsActive=1 are eligible for routing (114 of 163)
- IsActive=0 or NULL means the depot is inactive (legacy or decommissioned) -- excluded from routing
- The (FundingTypeID, PaymentTypeID, ProtocolID) triple uniquely identifies a depot endpoint
- PaymentTypeID: 1=Deposit, 2=Cashout, 3=Refund

**Dimension Relationships**:
- FundingTypeID references Dictionary.FundingType (payment method: CreditCard, Wire, Neteller, etc.)
- PaymentTypeID references Dictionary.PaymentType (1=Deposit, 2=Cashout, 3=Refund)
- ProtocolID references Dictionary.Protocol (specific gateway API)

### 2.2 DWH Completeness Note

**Excluded from DWH**: The production Billing.Depot table also has PayoutGeneration (automated payout file support) and Features (per-depot JSON/XML configuration flags). These columns are not in the SP SELECT and are not present in Dim_BillingDepot. Analyses requiring payout generation capability or feature flags must query the production source.

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE distributed with a CLUSTERED INDEX on DepotID. REPLICATE is correct for a 163-row lookup -- every distribution node holds a local copy, eliminating data movement on JOINs. The clustered index on DepotID supports efficient point lookups.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, no partitioning needed for a 163-row reference table. Expected as a MANAGED Delta table.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| All active payment depots | WHERE IsActive = 1 |
| Deposit depots by payment method | WHERE PaymentTypeID = 1, GROUP BY FundingTypeID |
| Cashout-capable depots | WHERE PaymentTypeID = 2 AND IsActive = 1 |
| Depots for a specific gateway | WHERE ProtocolID = N |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_BillingProtocolMIDSettingsID | ON DepotID | MID configuration per depot |
| Fact tables (deposit/cashout) | ON DepotID | Resolve depot name and attributes for transactions |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **IsActive NULL = Inactive**: The column is nullable. NULL should be treated as inactive (not eligible for routing). Use `WHERE IsActive = 1` rather than `WHERE IsActive <> 0`.
- **No InsertDate**: Unlike most other Dim_ tables loaded by SP_Dictionaries, this table has only UpdateDate (no InsertDate, no StatusID, no DWH surrogate key).
- **PayoutGeneration/Features not in DWH**: Two production columns are excluded. For payout batch analysis, the production source must be queried directly.
- **163 rows total, 114 active**: Inactive rows represent legacy/decommissioned gateway integrations. Do not assume all rows are usable.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_BillingProtocolMIDSettingsID is the DWH version of etoro.Billing.ProtocolMIDSettings -- the payment routing configuration table. It maps every combination of payment parameter + depot + trading mode + regulatory jurisdiction + currency to a specific Value (the MID, Merchant ID, or protocol identifier string) used to route transactions through a specific payment processor endpoint.

When a deposit is processed, the system looks up this table to determine which MID to use for the given depot, regulation, and currency. The ProtocolMIDSettingsID foreign key in deposit and withdrawal transaction tables references this table to record which routing configuration was used for each payment.

Source: etoro.Billing.ProtocolMIDSettings on etoroDB-REAL. Exported daily to Bronze/etoro/Billing/ProtocolMIDSettings/ and staged into DWH_staging.etoro_Billing_ProtocolMIDSettings. SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse loads from that staging table using a TRUNCATE + INSERT pattern. The production ID column is renamed to ProtocolMIDSettingsID in DWH. UpdateDate is set to GETDATE() at load time.

Row composition (approximate, based on production wiki at 1,470 rows; DWH has 1,851 as of 2026-03-11):
- DepotModeID: ~60% Demo (2), ~37% Live (1), ~3% General (0)
- SubTypeID: ~94% default (0), ~6% alternate (3)
- MerchantAccountID: ~25% have a specific merchant account override; ~75% NULL

**SENSITIVE DATA**: The Value column contains MID strings, API keys, and merchant credentials. Do not include in unmasked reports or logs.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 MID Routing Lookup

**What**: Given a depot + regulation + currency + mode, retrieve the MID/protocol string (Value) to use for payment processing.

**Columns Involved**: `ProtocolMIDSettingsID`, `ParameterID`, `DepotID`, `DepotModeID`, `RegulationID`, `CurrencyID`, `Value`, `SubTypeID`, `MerchantAccountID`

**Rules**:
- Primary lookup key: (ParameterID, DepotID, DepotModeID, RegulationID, CurrencyID) -- the logical PK from production
- CurrencyID=0 means "any currency" -- applies regardless of transaction currency
- SubTypeID=0 is the default routing path; SubTypeID=3 is an alternate routing path
- MerchantAccountID (when set) provides finer-grained routing to a specific acquiring account within a depot

**Primary reader**: Billing.GetProtocolMIDSettings(@RegulationID, @DepotID, @CurrencyID, @MerchantAccountID)

### 2.2 Depot Mode Segmentation (Live vs Demo)

**What**: Live and Demo accounts use separate MID entries to route to different processing environments.

**Columns Involved**: `DepotModeID`

| DepotModeID | Meaning | Approx Count |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| 0 | General (applies to both modes) | ~3% |
| 1 | Live trading accounts | ~37% |
| 2 | Demo accounts | ~60% |

**Rules**:
- High Demo count (60%) reflects that demo deposits use the same routing infrastructure with sandbox MIDs
- When routing a payment, the system selects the matching DepotModeID based on whether the customer has a live or demo account

### 2.3 Regulatory Segmentation

**What**: Each regulatory entity (CySEC, FCA, ASIC, etc.) has its own set of MIDs reflecting eToro's multi-jurisdiction legal structure.

**Columns Involved**: `RegulationID`

**Rules**:
- RegulationID=0: applies to all regulations (general fallback)
- RegulationID=1: CySEC (eToro EU)
- RegulationID=2: FCA (eToro UK)
- Additional values for ASIC, FINRA, and other regulatory entities
- Ensures transactions route through the correct legal entity's acquiring relationship

### 2.4 SubTypeID and MerchantAccountID Routing

**What**: Fine-grained routing controls within a (depot, mode, regulation, currency) combination.

**Columns Involved**: `SubTypeID`, `MerchantAccountID`

**Rules**:
- SubTypeID=0: default routing (94% of rows)
- SubTypeID=3: alternate sub-routing for specific processor subsets (6% of rows)
- MerchantAccountID (when set): links to a specific merchant account in Billing.MerchantAccountValues for finer routing

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE distributed with a CLUSTERED INDEX on DepotID. With ~1,851 rows, REPLICATE is acceptable -- every node holds a full copy, enabling zero-movement JOINs when filtering by DepotID. The clustered index on DepotID optimizes lookups from deposit/cashout fact tables.

**Note**: Unlike the production table (clustered on ID), the DWH clusters on DepotID. Queries by ProtocolMIDSettingsID range scans will not benefit from the clustered index; use DepotID-based lookups for best performance.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, partitioning is optional at this row count. If partitioned, partition by RegulationID or DepotID for routing lookups. Expected as a MANAGED Delta table.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| MID config for a specific depot | WHERE DepotID = N AND DepotModeID IN (0,1) |
| All Live mode entries for a regulation | WHERE DepotModeID = 1 AND RegulationID = N |
| Entries with merchant account overrides | WHERE MerchantAccountID IS NOT NULL |
| Row count by mode | GROUP BY DepotModeID |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_BillingDepot | ON Dim_BillingDepot.DepotID = Dim_BillingProtocolMIDSettingsID.DepotID | Resolve depot name and payment method |
| Fact deposit/cashout tables | ON ProtocolMIDSettingsID | Identify which MID config was used per transaction |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **Value column is SENSITIVE**: Contains MID strings, API keys, and merchant credentials. Exclude from unmasked exports, logs, and reports.
- **ProtocolMIDSettingsID = production ID**: The DWH renames the production `ID` column to `ProtocolMIDSettingsID`. These are the same values; use ProtocolMIDSettingsID when joining to fact tables that store the original ID.
- **CurrencyID=0 = any currency**: Most rows use CurrencyID=0 as a wildcard -- they apply to all currencies, not just currency 0. Do not filter `WHERE CurrencyID = 0` expecting only "no-currency" rows.
- **UpdateDate staleness warning**: Live data as of 2026-03-18 shows UpdateDate=2026-03-11, suggesting the ETL may not have run for ~7 days. Monitor UpdateDate for freshness issues.
- **Clustered on DepotID (not ID)**: Production clusters on ID for sequential inserts; DWH clusters on DepotID for JOIN performance. This changes query plan behavior.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_Regulation defines the 15 regulatory jurisdictions under which eToro operates globally. Each regulation represents a financial authority (CySEC, FCA, ASIC, FinCEN, etc.) and maps to an eToro legal entity holding the corresponding license. This classification drives multi-jurisdiction compliance - it determines which rules apply to each customer, what instruments they can trade, what leverage limits are enforced, and how their funds are segregated. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, Dictionary.Regulation)

RegulationID is one of the most frequently joined columns in the DWH. It is assigned to users at registration (CustomerStatic.RegulationID) and propagated through every subsequent operation - deposits, trading, copy-trading, and compliance reporting. V_Dim_Customer joins Dim_Regulation to resolve the regulation name for every customer.

**DWH vs Production differences**: The DWH strips 6 columns from production (IsUSA, JurisdictionName, BankID, RegulationLongName, RegulationShortName, DefaultRegulationID) and adds 3 DWH-specific columns (DWHRegulationID = ID alias, StatusID = hardcoded 1, ClusterRegulationID = grouping logic). Analysts needing US/non-US split or jurisdiction names should reference the upstream wiki or query production via the Bronze layer.

Loaded daily by SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse via TRUNCATE+INSERT from DWH_staging.etoro_Dictionary_Regulation. All 15 rows have StatusID=1 (Active). No sentinel row.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 ClusterRegulationID Grouping

**What**: The ETL groups certain regulations into a single cluster (ID=1) for analytics aggregation.

**Columns Involved**: `ClusterRegulationID`, `ID`

**Rules**:
- IDs 0 (None), 1 (CySEC), 5 (BVI) -> ClusterRegulationID=1 (grouped as "CySEC/BVI/None" cluster)
- All other IDs -> ClusterRegulationID = ID (each regulation is its own cluster)

**Rationale**: BVI (5) is the non-US fallback regulation for users in jurisdictions without a specific eToro entity. CySEC (1) is the primary EU regulation. None (0) is the sentinel for unassigned users. Grouping them under cluster 1 allows DWH analytics to treat these three as a single reporting unit.

```
ClusterRegulationID mapping:
  ID=0 (None)    -> Cluster 1
  ID=1 (CySEC)   -> Cluster 1
  ID=5 (BVI)     -> Cluster 1
  All others     -> Cluster = ID (FCA=2, NFA=3, ASIC=4, eToroUS=6, ...)
```

### 2.2 DWH Column Gaps vs Production

**What**: The DWH drops 6 production columns that are needed for full compliance analysis.

**Columns Dropped**:
- `IsUSA` - US/non-US jurisdiction flag (critical for instrument availability branching)
- `JurisdictionName` - eToro legal entity name (e.g., "eToro EU", "eToro UK")
- `BankID` - FK to Dictionary.Bank (custodian banking partner)
- `RegulationLongName` - Full formal name (e.g., "Cyprus Securities Exchange Commission")
- `RegulationShortName` - Abbreviated code for compact display
- `DefaultRegulationID` - Self-reference fallback (non-US->BVI, US->eToroUS)

**Impact**: DWH analytics that need US vs non-US split must either hardcode the IDs (6, 7, 8, 12, 14 are US) or join to the Bronze layer. See Section 3.4 Gotchas.

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with CLUSTERED INDEX on ID. With 15 rows, REPLICATE is optimal. Join on ID directly.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, the Gold export at `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_dim_regulation` is Parquet. Read the entire table for any lookup.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resolve RegulationID to name in customer data | `LEFT JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_Regulation r ON r.ID = cs.RegulationID` |
| Group analytics by regulation cluster | `GROUP BY r.ClusterRegulationID` |
| US vs non-US split (without IsUSA) | `WHERE r.ID IN (6, 7, 8, 12, 14)` for US; else non-US |
| Full customer record with regulation | Use `DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer` (pre-joins Dim_Regulation) |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.CustomerStatic / V_Dim_Customer | ON r.ID = cs.RegulationID | Resolve regulation name per customer |
| DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer | Dim_Regulation already joined (INNER JOIN on RegulationID) | Use view instead of re-joining |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **IsUSA not in DWH**: Production Dictionary.Regulation.IsUSA (US=1, non-US=0) is dropped by ETL. DWH analysts must hardcode: US regulations = IDs 6, 7, 8, 12, 14.
- **DWHRegulationID = ID**: These two columns always have the same value. DWHRegulationID is an ETL alias and appears redundant. Prefer ID for joins.
- **StatusID always 1**: Hardcoded Active for all rows. Not a meaningful filter.
- **Cluster 1 includes 3 regulations**: ClusterRegulationID=1 covers None (0), CySEC (1), and BVI (5). Aggregating by ClusterRegulationID will merge these three.
- **V_Dim_Customer uses INNER JOIN**: V_Dim_Customer has `INNER JOIN Dim_Regulation ON ID = RegulationID`. Customers with NULL RegulationID would be excluded.
- **Production has 6 more columns**: If you need IsUSA, JurisdictionName, or DefaultRegulationID, use the Bronze/staging layer or etoro.Dictionary.Regulation directly.

# DWH_dbo.Dim_CardType

> 18-row replicated dimension table listing payment card network brands (Visa, MasterCard, Diners, etc.) with their active status.

## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_CardType is a small lookup dimension defining the 18 payment card network brands recognized by the eToro platform in the DWH layer. It is a subset of the production `Dictionary.CardType` table (which has 32 entries). When a customer deposits via credit or debit card, the card's BIN (Bank Identification Number) is resolved to a CardTypeID, and this dimension provides the human-readable brand name and active status.

The table was loaded via a one-time migration from production (`DWH_Migration.Dim_CardType` staging table) and all 18 rows share the same UpdateDate of 2019-06-30, indicating no incremental refreshes have occurred since the initial load. The Generic Pipeline exports this table daily to Unity Catalog as a Gold Override, but the underlying data has not changed.

Notable: the DWH copy carries only 18 of the 32 production card types (CardTypeID 0–17) and does NOT include the `Is3dsOn` column from the production source. The `IsActive` values in the DWH differ from production for some card types (e.g., CardTypeID 0 "None" is IsActive=1 in DWH but IsActive=0 in production; Maestro (8) is IsActive=0 in DWH but IsActive=1 in production), suggesting the DWH snapshot was taken at a different point in time.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Card Brand Lookup

**What**: Maps CardTypeID integers to human-readable card network brand names.

**Columns Involved**: `CardTypeID`, `CarTypeName`

**Rules**:
- CardTypeID 0 = "None" (fallback when BIN lookup fails to identify a card network)
- CardTypeID 1 = Visa, 2 = Master Card, 3 = Diners, 8 = Maestro — the four historically active brands in production
- CardTypeIDs 4–7, 9–17 are inactive/legacy brands (Amex, Fire Pay, JCB, American Express, Laser, Switch, UK Local Credit Card, Discover, Local Card, China Union Pay, Solo, Cirrus, GE Capital)

### 2.2 Active Status Flag

**What**: Indicates whether a card brand is accepted for deposits.

**Columns Involved**: `IsActive`

**Rules**:
- IsActive = 1: Card brand is accepted for deposits. In the DWH snapshot: Visa (1), Master Card (2), Diners (3), and None (0) show as active
- IsActive = 0: Card brand is not accepted — card will be rejected at deposit time
- Note: DWH values may diverge from current production state (snapshot from 2019-06-30)

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

- **REPLICATE** distribution — full copy on every compute node. Ideal for this 18-row lookup: JOINs never require data movement.
- **CLUSTERED INDEX** on `CardTypeID` — efficient for point lookups and range scans by ID.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| What card brands are active? | `SELECT * FROM DWH_dbo.Dim_CardType WHERE IsActive = 1` |
| Resolve CardTypeID to name | JOIN to Dim_CardType on CardTypeID |
| Full card type list | `SELECT * FROM DWH_dbo.Dim_CardType ORDER BY CardTypeID` (only 18 rows) |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Fact_BillingDeposit | `ON d.CardTypeID = ct.CardTypeID` | Resolve card brand for deposit transactions |
| Dim_CountryBin | `ON cb.CardTypeID = ct.CardTypeID` | Link BIN records to card brand names |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **Column name typo**: The column is `CarTypeName` (missing "d" — not `CardTypeName`). This is in the DDL and cannot be changed without an ALTER.
- **IsActive divergence**: DWH IsActive values reflect a 2019 snapshot and may differ from current production `Dictionary.CardType.IsActive`.
- **Missing Is3dsOn**: The production `Dictionary.CardType` has an `Is3dsOn` column for 3D Secure configuration that is NOT carried into the DWH dimension. If 3DS status is needed, query production directly.
- **Subset of production**: Only 18 of 32 production card types are present (CardTypeIDs 0–17). CardTypeIDs 18–31 are not in the DWH.

# BI_DB_dbo.BI_DB_DepositWithdrawFee

## 1. Overview

Daily **deposit, withdrawal, and fee / reversal-style cash events** at transaction grain, enriched with customer snapshot attributes, payment method and card metadata, merchant (**MID**) fields, and **PIPs** (payment processing) amounts in USD. Each row represents one logical transaction row from **Fact_Deposit_State** or **Fact_Cashout_State** (plus billing dimension joins); **Amount**, **AmountUSD**, and **PIPsCalculation** are signed after load using a transaction-type direction map.

**Row grain**: One row per **DepositWithdrawID** / **TransactionID** combination for the processed **DateID** (deposits and withdraws unions), after deduplication rules on billing withdraw.

---

## 2. Business context

Replaces legacy deposit/withdraw logic with the RnD PIPS-based pipeline (2025). Used for **finance reconciliation**, payment analytics, and geographic / method attribution (**RegCountry**, **BinCountry**, **CardType**, **MIDName**, etc.).

**Key business rules** (from `SP_DepositWithdrawFee`):
- **Scope**: Rows where **ModificationDateID** = **@StartDateID** from **Fact_Deposit_State** (deposits vs non-deposit types) and **Fact_Cashout_State** (withdraws vs non-withdraw types).
- **Withdraw path**: **Fact_Cashout_State** joined to deduped **Fact_BillingWithdraw** rows present in **Fact_Cashout_State** for that date (handles duplicate billing rows).
- **Deposit path**: **Fact_Deposit_State** joined to **Fact_BillingDeposit** for funding metadata.
- **ABS then sign**: Source amounts are loaded with **ABS**; final **UPDATE** applies **#amountDirections** so **Withdraw** / **Refund** / **Chargeback** types are negative where configured.
- **PIPsCalculation**: **ABS(ISNULL(PIPsInUSD,0))** at insert; further multiplied or negated by direction rules and special-case **UPDATE**s for rollback / chargeback-reversal rows joined to **Fact_CustomerAction**.
- **CreditTypeID**: Intentionally **NULL** in the modern proc (per change history).
- **MOPCountry**, **IsGermanBaFin**: **NULL** literals in current build.
- **IsIBANTrade**: **1** when billing **FlowID** = 2 (withdraw) or = 1 (deposit) per branch logic.
- **TransactionID**: **CAST(DepositID AS varchar) + 'D'** or **CAST(WPID AS varchar) + 'W'**.

**Related table**: **BI_DB_DepositWithdrawFee_Reversals** receives deposit/withdraw **reversal** subsets from the same SP (not documented in this file).

Description: this is a temporary solution to bring the deposit reversal pips into finance (previously only available through BO). 
			the end game of this should be to receive in views from DBAs on production - we recompute many hard coded things here
			which can be changed at the source without being informed to us, and we will diverge from the production data (BO)
			the logics here are complex, unfoptunately synapse doesnot support select statements within UDFs so the DBA functions 
			could not be copied to synapse, instead they are translated to tables with joins and apply statements. these are based 
			on the following stored procedures and functions, if needed you can look them up in the DBA github repositories: 

			main SP: etoro/etoro/BackOffice/Stored Procedures/BackOffice.GetRiskExposureReportPCIVersion.sql
			functions: etoro/etoro/Billing/Functions/Billing.GetMerchantDetailsForOneAccountByDepotOnly.sql
