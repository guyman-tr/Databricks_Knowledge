# Regen Harness — Writer Prompt

# Regen Harness — Writer (single-object mode)

You are running the DWH Semantic Documentation pipeline on **ONE OBJECT** in
isolated regen-harness mode. This is NOT the normal batch loop. You are NOT
reading `_index.md`, NOT updating any index file, NOT processing other
objects, NOT running cross-schema sync. You document one object end-to-end and
exit.

---

## ⛔ MCP PRE-FLIGHT — MANDATORY

Before reading any rule files or DDL:

1. Call `mcp__synapse_sql__execute_sql_read_only` with `SELECT 1 AS mcp_preflight`.
2. **If it fails or the tool does not exist**: print `REGEN ABORT: Synapse MCP unavailable` and **EXIT IMMEDIATELY**. A wiki without live data sampling is INCOMPLETE and WILL FAIL the adversarial judge.
3. **If it succeeds**: print `MCP PRE-FLIGHT: PASS` and continue.

No exceptions. No "code-only documentation" fallback. No "I'll skip Phase 2 because the table looks dormant" — the judge sees the dormant footer too and will fail you for missing data evidence.

---

## ⛔ PRE-RESOLVED UPSTREAM CONTEXT — your Tier 1 inheritance source is below, USE IT

The block titled **"## PRE-RESOLVED UPSTREAM BUNDLE"** in this prompt was
assembled **deterministically by the harness, before you started**. It contains:

- The **DDL** for the object you are documenting (verbatim from SSDT).
- Every **upstream wiki** the harness could resolve from the existing
  `.lineage.md` plus DDL-derived references — both local Synapse wikis and
  remote production-DB wikis (DB_Schema, ExperianceDBs, etc.).
- For any stored procedure mentioned in the lineage, the **SP source code**
  pulled from `DataPlatform\SynapseSQLPool1\sql_dp_prod_we\...`.

**Treat this bundle as your AUTHORITATIVE source for Tier 1 inheritance.** You
are NOT permitted to claim "no upstream wiki could be found" if the bundle
contains one. You ARE permitted to read additional files via the `Read` tool
if you need more context.

### Tier rules — re-stated, NON-NEGOTIABLE

For every column in the object:

1. **Passthrough or rename WITH upstream wiki present in the bundle** →
   **Tier 1**. Description MUST be a verbatim quote from the upstream wiki.
   Do not paraphrase. Do not "improve". Do not generalize vendor names. Do not
   drop NULL semantics. The judge will run a character-by-character
   comparison.
2. **ETL-computed** (CASE / arithmetic / aggregation visible in the SP source) →
   **Tier 2** with the transform stated.
3. **Dim-lookup passthrough** (`SELECT dim.X` with no transform AND `Dim_X`
   has its own Tier 1 origin documented in the bundle) → **Tier 1 with the
   dim's origin** (e.g. `Dictionary.Country`), NOT `Tier 2 via SP_X` and NOT
   `Tier 1 via Dim_X` (Dim_X is a relay, not a root). Quote the dim's wiki
   verbatim.
4. **No source traceable from bundle, DDL, JOINs, or SP source** →
   **Tier 3** with explicit reason. Be specific: "PII column, no upstream wiki
   located, name suggests …".
5. **`Tier 4 — inferred from name`** is BANNED unless the bundle explicitly
   shows the column has no upstream and no SP code touches it. Lazy Tier 4 is
   the #1 reason wikis fail the judge. If you are tempted to write Tier 4
   with no other evidence, you have skipped Phase 9 — go back and read the
   SP source in the bundle.

### Footer rules

- If the bundle contains AT LEAST ONE upstream wiki: the footer MUST identify
  the production source(s). Writing `Production Source: Unknown (dormant)`
  when the bundle proves an upstream exists is an automatic fail.
- If `_no_upstream_found.txt` exists in the regen folder: it is OK to mark
  the table as dormant in the footer, but you MUST still ground every column
  description in the DDL + SP code rather than `Tier 4 — inferred`.

---

## Output paths — write here, NOT into the main wiki tree

Write all THREE output files into:

```
audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/
  {Object}.md
  {Object}.lineage.md
  {Object}.review-needed.md
```

`{Schema}`, `{Object}`, and `{N}` are passed in via the prompt header below.

**DO NOT** write into `knowledge/synapse/Wiki/` under any circumstances. The
main tree is read-only for this run. **DO NOT** modify `_index.md` or any
`_batch_context.json`. **DO NOT** generate `.alter.sql`. **DO NOT** run Phase
16 — the adversarial judge runs as a separate, fresh claude process AFTER you
exit. Pretending to evaluate yourself wastes tokens.

---

## Pipeline scope for this single object

Run phases 1 through 11 inclusive. Skip Phase 16. Skip Phase 11W (no ALTER).
Skip cross-object index updates. Skip `_batch_context.json` writes.

Required phase gates (you must print them as you complete each):

```
PHASE GATE — {Schema}.{Object}:
  [x] P1 DDL          [x] P2 Sample        [x] P3 Dist
  [x] P4 Lookup       [x] P5 JOIN          [x] P6 BizLogic
  [x] P7 Views        [x] P8 SP-scan       [x] P9 SP-logic
  [x] P9B ETL         [x] P10 Jira         [x] P10A Upstream
  [x] P10B Lineage    → Ready for P11
```

If a phase truly cannot run (e.g. no SPs reference the table), mark it `[-]`
with a one-line reason. Skipping P2 or P3 because "the table is small" is
NOT a valid reason — sample it.

---

## Outputs — three files, exact shape

Follow the GOLDEN-REFERENCE in
`.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/GOLDEN-REFERENCE.mdc`.

1. **`{Object}.lineage.md`** — written FIRST (Phase 10B). Source Objects
   table + Column Lineage table. Every Tier 1 row must point to a file in the
   pre-resolved bundle (or to a wiki you read independently).
2. **`{Object}.md`** — the main wiki, 8 sections, every column in
   Section 4's Elements table, every description ending with
   `(Tier N — source)`.
3. **`{Object}.review-needed.md`** — items needing human review. MUST NOT
   contain a `## 4. Elements` section.

---

## Final checklist before exiting

Print, verbatim:

```
OUTPUT CHECK — {Schema}.{Object}:
  [x] .lineage.md    written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.lineage.md
  [x] .md            written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.md
  [x] .review-needed.md written → audits/regen-sample/{Schema}/{Object}/regen/attempt_{N}/{Object}.review-needed.md
  [-] .alter.sql     deferred (regen harness — judge runs next)
  Tier1 columns: N    Tier2: N    Tier3: N    Tier4: N
  Bundle inheritance used: YES/NO  (NO is only valid if `_no_upstream_found.txt` exists)
```

Then EXIT. Do not run a self-evaluation. Do not "double-check by re-reading
the wiki you just wrote". Do not append a verdict block. The judge runs in a
separate process with its own context.

# build-wiki-dwh-batch

You are running the DWH Semantic Documentation pipeline for a Synapse DWH schema.
**Wiki-only mode** — generate documentation files only. ALTER scripts are generated separately later via `/generate-alter-dwh`.

## ⛔ MCP PRE-FLIGHT — NON-NEGOTIABLE, CHECK BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

Before loading rules, before reading the index, before planning anything:

1. **Test Synapse MCP**: Call `mcp__synapse_sql__execute_sql_read_only` with `SELECT 1 AS mcp_preflight`
2. **If it fails or the tool does not exist**: Print `BATCH ABORT: Synapse MCP unavailable` and **EXIT IMMEDIATELY**. Do NOT proceed. Do NOT fall back to "prior batch context data". Do NOT use a "schema practice" of skipping MCP. A wiki without live data sampling is INCOMPLETE and WILL NOT PASS the adversarial evaluator. STOP HERE.
3. **If it succeeds**: Print `MCP PRE-FLIGHT: PASS` and continue to Instructions.

There is NO exception to this rule. No "prior context", no "code-only documentation", no "graceful degradation". MCP down = batch aborted. Period.

---

## Instructions (regen-harness, single object)

1. **Load rules** — read these in order before anything else:
   - `.cursor/rules/semantic-layer-core/repo-first-access.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/00-execution-card.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/mcp-query-rules.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/GOLDEN-REFERENCE.mdc`
   - `.cursor/rules/dwh-semantic-doc/10.5b-tier1-enforcement.mdc`

2. **Skip batch planning** — do NOT read `_index.md`, do NOT touch
   `_batch_context.json`, do NOT scan the blacklist. The harness
   already chose this object.

3. **Run the pipeline for THIS object only**: phases 1 through 11
   inclusive. Use the pre-resolved upstream bundle (provided below)
   as your authoritative Tier 1 source. Generate three files in
   `audits/regen-sample/{schema}/{object}/regen/attempt_{N}/`:
   `.lineage.md`, `.md`, `.review-needed.md`. Do NOT generate
   `.alter.sql`. Do NOT modify any file under `knowledge/synapse/Wiki/`.

4. **Skip Phase 16** — the adversarial judge runs in a separate,
   fresh claude process after you exit. Self-evaluation here wastes
   tokens and pollutes the comparison.

5. **Exit cleanly** after printing the OUTPUT CHECK block defined in
   the Regen Harness preamble.

## Key resources

- **SSDT DDL files**: `C:\Users\guyman\Documents\github\DataPlatform\` (repo-first for structure)

---

## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Dim_Instrument` is the DWH's master reference for all tradeable instruments on the eToro platform. It extends the foundational trade pair definition from `Trade.Instrument` (which specifies the buy/sell currency pairing for each instrument) with rich analytics metadata: display names and company info from `Trade.InstrumentMetaData`, trading configuration from `Trade.ProviderToInstrument`, financial market data (market cap, ADV, shares outstanding) from the Rankings/StockInfo system, Bloomberg-style asset classification, and futures-specific parameters. The result is a 47-column analytics hub that serves as the primary instrument lookup for fact table enrichment across DWH analytics.

The production source is `etoro.Trade.GetInstrument` (a view on the production etoroDB-REAL server), which combines `Trade.Instrument` with multiple related tables. The Generic Pipeline exports this view daily to `Bronze/etoro/Trade/GetInstrument/` (UC: `trading.bronze_etoro_trade_getinstrument`). The DWH ETL SP (`SP_Dim_Instrument`) then joins this staging data with six additional staging tables to produce the full 47-column Dim_Instrument. Post-load UPDATE statements enrich price-server tracking, asset classification, and financial fundamentals. Source: upstream wiki available at `Trade/Tables/Trade.Instrument.md` (quality 9.1/10).

The ETL is a full TRUNCATE + INSERT + multiple UPDATEs, running daily with a `@dt` date parameter. `UpdateDate` and `InsertDate` are both set to `GETDATE()` at load time and do NOT reflect production modification times. The SP ends by calling `SP_Dim_Instrument_Snapshot @dt` to update the `Dim_Instrument_Snapshot` table (daily snapshot of futures configuration columns). As of 2026-03-19, the table contains 15,707 rows: 82% Stocks, 8% ETFs, 4% Crypto, 3% Commodities, 2% Indices, 1% Currencies.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Buy/Sell Currency Pairing

**What**: Every instrument is defined as a pair of assets from `Dictionary.Currency`/`Dim_Currency`. The pairing determines how prices are quoted, how positions are settled, and how P&L is converted to account currency.

**Columns Involved**: `BuyCurrencyID`, `SellCurrencyID`, `BuyCurrency`, `SellCurrency`

**Rules**:
- For **forex pairs**: BuyCurrencyID is the base currency, SellCurrencyID is the quote currency (e.g., InstrumentID=1: EUR/USD = BuyCurrencyID=2/EUR, SellCurrencyID=1/USD)
- For **stocks/ETFs/crypto**: BuyCurrencyID equals the asset's own InstrumentID in Dim_Currency, and SellCurrencyID is the denomination currency (USD for US stocks, EUR for European stocks, GBX for UK pence-quoted stocks)
- `BuyCurrency` and `SellCurrency` are DWH-added text abbreviations (denormalized from Dictionary.Currency via SP JOIN)
- InstrumentID=0: system/ETL null-sentinel record with all zero/NA values

**Diagram**:
```
Forex:  ID=1  -> Buy=EUR(2)  / Sell=USD(1)   = EUR/USD pair
Stock:  ID=1001 -> Buy=AAPL(1001) / Sell=USD(1) = Apple in USD
EuroSt: ID=1203 -> Buy=Bayer(1203) / Sell=EUR(2) = Bayer AG in EUR
Crypto: ID=XXXX -> Buy=BTC(?) / Sell=USD(1)     = Bitcoin in USD
```

### 2.2 InstrumentType and IsMajor Dual Representation

**What**: Two DWH-specific computed/reformatted columns encode enum values as human-readable text.

**Columns Involved**: `InstrumentTypeID`, `InstrumentType`, `IsMajorID`, `IsMajor`

**Rules**:
- `InstrumentType` is CASE-computed in the SP from `InstrumentTypeID`: 1=Currencies, 2=Commodities, 4=Indices, 5=Stocks, 6=ETF, 10=Crypto Currencies, else=Other. Note: type IDs 3, 7, 8, 9 are not defined (gap exists for historical reasons)
- `IsMajorID` = production `IsMajor` bit value (0 or 1). `IsMajor` = text version ('Yes' or 'No'). Analysts should use `IsMajorID` for filtering, `IsMajor` for display
- IsMajor=Yes: 6,963 instruments (major forex + popular stocks/ETFs). IsMajor=No: 8,743 instruments
- DWHInstrumentID always equals InstrumentID (redundant copy, same as the DWHXxxID pattern across all DWH Dim tables)
- StatusID is hardcoded to 1 for all real rows (ETL artifact; NULL only for ID=0 placeholder)

### 2.3 IsFuture Derivation and Futures Columns

**What**: Futures instruments are identified by membership in InstrumentGroups(GroupID=25), and carry additional configuration columns not present for non-futures instruments.

**Columns Involved**: `IsFuture`, `Multiplier`, `ProviderMarginPerLot`, `eToroMarginPerLot`, `SettlementTime`

**Rules**:
- `IsFuture = 1` when the instrument is a member of `DWH_staging.etoro_Trade_InstrumentGroups` with `GroupID=25`. Computed via CASE in SP_Dim_Instrument.
- `Multiplier`: contract size multiplier from `Trade.FuturesMetaData`. NULL for non-futures.
- `ProviderMarginPerLot`: initial margin requirement from the liquidity provider, from `Trade.FuturesInstrumentsInitialMarginByProviderMapping`. NULL for non-futures.
- `eToroMarginPerLot`: eToro's own margin per lot (in asset currency) from `Trade.ProviderToInstrument.InitialMarginInAssetCurrency`. NULL for non-futures.
- `SettlementTime`: daily/weekly settlement time from `Trade.ProviderToInstrument`, formatted as TIME(0) by the SP.

### 2.4 Financial Fundamentals (Post-Load Updates)

**What**: Market data columns are populated via post-load UPDATE statements joining to the Rankings/StockInfo data lake.

**Columns Involved**: `ADV_Last3Months`, `MKTcap`, `SharesOutStanding`, `AssetClass`, `IndustryGroup`, `PlatformSector`, `PlatformIndustry`

**Rules**:
- `ADV_Last3Months`: Average Daily Volume over last 3 months (MetadataID=8557). NULL for non-stock instruments or instruments without Rankings data.
- `MKTcap`: Market Capitalization in USD (MetadataID=8735 for stocks, fallback to MetadataID=9315 CryptoMarketCap for crypto). NULL if not covered by Rankings.
- `SharesOutStanding`: Total shares outstanding in units (MetadataID=8444). Stocks only.
- `AssetClass` / `IndustryGroup`: Bloomberg-style classification from `Ext_Dim_Instrument_Classification_Static`. More granular than InstrumentType.
- `PlatformSector` / `PlatformIndustry`: eToro platform taxonomy (MetadataID=8436/8280), may differ from Bloomberg AssetClass/IndustryGroup.
- `ReceivedOnPriceServer`: First date/time an instrument was seen on the price server. POST-LOAD from `Ext_Dim_Instrument_ReceivedOnPriceServerStatic`. NULL for instruments not yet priced.

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed (all 15,707 rows available on every compute node) with a CLUSTERED INDEX on `InstrumentID`. Since virtually every fact table JOINs to `Dim_Instrument` on `InstrumentID`, replication eliminates shuffle overhead. The clustered index supports range scans and direct lookups efficiently.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, the Gold export is pending write-objects configuration. At 15,707 rows, partitioning is not beneficial -- suggest Z-ORDER on `InstrumentID` for join performance, and `InstrumentTypeID` for type-filtered analytics.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Get instrument name and type by ID | `JOIN Dim_Instrument ON InstrumentID; SELECT Name, InstrumentType` |
| Find all major instruments by asset class | `WHERE IsMajorID = 1 AND AssetClass = 'Technology'` |
| Find instruments eligible for long/short | `WHERE AllowBuy = 1 AND AllowSell = 1 AND Tradable = 1` |
| Get market cap for a position | `JOIN Dim_Instrument ON InstrumentID; SELECT MKTcap` |
| Find futures instruments with settlement | `WHERE IsFuture = 1 AND SettlementTime IS NOT NULL` |
| Find US stocks with ISIN | `WHERE InstrumentTypeID = 5 AND ISINCountryCode = 'US' AND ISINCode IS NOT NULL` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Currency | `ON Dim_Currency.CurrencyID = Dim_Instrument.BuyCurrencyID` | Resolve buy-side currency/asset details |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Currency | `ON Dim_Currency.CurrencyID = Dim_Instrument.SellCurrencyID` | Resolve sell-side denomination currency |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_HistorySplitRatio | `ON InstrumentID + date range` | Get split adjustment ratios for historical price normalization |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Instrument_Snapshot | `ON InstrumentID + DateID` | Get point-in-time futures config for historical analysis |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_CurrencyPriceWithSplit | `ON InstrumentID` | Join to price history |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **InstrumentID=0 is the null-sentinel placeholder**: All fields are 0/NA/NULL. Always filter `WHERE InstrumentID > 0` for analytics.
- **DWHInstrumentID always equals InstrumentID**: This is a redundant copy column -- do not use it as a distinct identifier.
- **StatusID is hardcoded 1**: This column conveys no information (all rows = 1 except the ID=0 placeholder). Do not filter on it.
- **UpdateDate and InsertDate are both ETL timestamps**: Neither reflects when the instrument was created or last modified in production. They reflect the last ETL run (daily, ~midnight).
- **InstrumentType gaps**: TypeIDs 3, 7, 8, 9 are not used. The CASE expression returns 'Other' for any unmapped typeID.
- **IsMajorID vs IsMajor**: Use `IsMajorID` (int 0/1) for WHERE/GROUP BY. Use `IsMajor` ('Yes'/'No') for display only.
- **NULL fundamentals**: ADV_Last3Months, MKTcap, SharesOutStanding are NULL for non-stock instruments and for instruments not covered by Rankings data. Always use LEFT JOIN or ISNULL() when using these for aggregations.
- **AllowBuy/AllowSell = 0 means trading disabled**: Instruments with AllowBuy=0 cannot be opened in the specified direction. This changes dynamically in production but is updated daily in DWH.
- **Dim_Instrument vs Dim_Currency**: Dim_Currency (from Dictionary.Currency) is the master asset registry with type and currency info. Dim_Instrument (from Trade.Instrument) is the trading pair definition with full analytics enrichment. For basic instrument lookups, Dim_Currency suffices. For trading parameters, fundamentals, or pair analysis, use Dim_Instrument.

## 4. Elements

### Confidence Tier Legend

| Stars | Tier | Tag |
|-------|------|-----|
| ★★★★ | Tier 1 -- upstream wiki verbatim | `(Tier 1 -- upstream wiki, Trade.Instrument)` |
| ★★★ | Tier 2 -- Synapse SP code / DDL | `(Tier 2 -- SP_Dim_Instrument)` |
| ★★ | Tier 3 -- live data / structure | `(Tier 3 -- live data)` |
| ★ | Tier 4 -- inferred [UNVERIFIED] | `[UNVERIFIED] (Tier 4 -- inferred)` |

| # | Element | Type | Nullable | Description |
|---|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | InstrumentID | int | NO | Primary key identifying the tradeable instrument pair. Allocated by Trade.InstrumentAdd during instrument creation. Ranges from 0 (system placeholder) to ~21 million IDs allocated. Referenced by virtually every trading fact table and the Dim_Currency / Dim_HistorySplitRatio dimension tables. (Tier 1 -- upstream wiki, Trade.Instrument) |
| 2 | InstrumentTypeID | int | NO | Instrument type category: 1=Currencies (forex), 2=Commodities, 4=Indices, 5=Stocks, 6=ETF, 10=Crypto Currencies. Note TypeIDs 3, 7, 8, 9 are unused gaps. Distribution: Stocks 82%, ETF 8%, Crypto 4%, Commodities 3%, Indices 2%, Currencies 1%. (Tier 2 -- SP_Dim_Instrument) |
| 3 | InstrumentType | varchar(50) | NO | Text label for InstrumentTypeID -- DWH-computed via CASE: 1=Currencies, 2=Commodities, 4=Indices, 5=Stocks, 6=ETF, 10=Crypto Currencies, else=Other. Use InstrumentTypeID for filtering; InstrumentType for display. (Tier 2 -- SP_Dim_Instrument) |
| 4 | Name | varchar(50) | NO | Instrument name as defined in Trade.Instrument. For forex: pair notation (e.g., EUR/USD). For stocks: company name (e.g., Apple, Alphabet). For crypto: token name. This is the internal instrument name, not necessarily the display name shown to users (see InstrumentDisplayName). (Tier 3 -- live data, etoro.Trade.GetInstrument) |
| 5 | DWHInstrumentID | int | NO | Always equal to InstrumentID -- redundant copy following the DWH DWH{X}ID pattern. Use InstrumentID for all JOINs. (Tier 2 -- SP_Dim_Instrument) |
| 6 | StatusID | int | YES | Hardcoded to 1 for all real rows by SP_Dim_Instrument. NULL only for ID=0 placeholder. Conveys no business information. (Tier 2 -- SP_Dim_Instrument) |
| 7 | BuyCurrencyID | int | NO | The buy-side asset of the instrument pair. FK to DWH_dbo.Dim_Currency(CurrencyID). For forex: the base currency. For stocks/ETFs/crypto: the asset's own CurrencyID in Dim_Currency (BuyCurrencyID = InstrumentID for stocks). (Tier 1 -- upstream wiki, Trade.Instrument) |
| 8 | SellCurrencyID | int | NO | The sell-side (denomination) currency. FK to DWH_dbo.Dim_Currency(CurrencyID). For forex: the quote currency (e.g., USD in EUR/USD). For stocks: the trading denomination currency (USD, EUR, GBX). Only 67 distinct values since many assets share the same denomination. (Tier 1 -- upstream wiki, Trade.Instrument) |
| 9 | BuyCurrency | varchar(50) | NO | Text abbreviation of BuyCurrencyID -- denormalized from Dictionary.Currency.Abbreviation via SP JOIN. Example: EUR, AAPL, BTC. DWH-added for query convenience. (Tier 2 -- SP_Dim_Instrument) |
| 10 | SellCurrency | varchar(50) | NO | Text abbreviation of SellCurrencyID -- denormalized from Dictionary.Currency.Abbreviation. Example: USD, EUR, GBX (GBP pence). DWH-added for query convenience. (Tier 2 -- SP_Dim_Instrument) |

# JUDGE FEEDBACK FROM PREVIOUS ATTEMPT — apply ALL of these

Previous attempt scored **7.45** (FAIL). The adversarial judge required regeneration with the following specific fixes:

> Re-run with: (1) Re-tag InstrumentDisplayName as Tier 1 using verbatim Dim_Instrument wiki description: 'User-facing instrument display name from Trade.InstrumentMetaData. More descriptive than Name (e.g., 'Apple Inc.' vs 'Apple'). NULL for instruments without metadata entries.' (2) Fix InstrumentID Tier 1 description to restore dropped text: 'Ranges from 0 (system placeholder) to ~21 million IDs allocated.' and remove injected passthrough mechanism text. (3) Update lineage file to mark InstrumentDisplayName as Tier 1. (4) Add explicit Phase Gate Checklist section. (5) Update footer tier counts to 2 T1 / 19 T2.

Top issues from the judge:
1. [high] `InstrumentDisplayName (#14)` — Tagged Tier 2 (SP_Dim_Instrument, etoro_Trade_InstrumentMetaData) but this is a dim-lookup passthrough (SELECT Dim_Instrument.InstrumentDisplayName with no transform). Per tier rules, should be Tier 1 with the Dim_Instrument wiki description verbatim.
2. [high] `InstrumentID (#13)` — Tier 1 description paraphrased: dropped 'Ranges from 0 (system placeholder) to ~21 million IDs allocated' from upstream wiki. Injected non-upstream lineage text ('Passthrough from Dim_Instrument via Symbol/ISIN/CUSIP matching against Apex staging data') that belongs in Section 5, not in a Tier 1 verbatim description.
3. [medium] `Lineage file — InstrumentDisplayName` — Lineage file marks InstrumentDisplayName as Tier 2 with 'Dim-lookup passthrough' note, contradicting the dim-lookup passthrough rule which requires Tier 1.
4. [low] `Footer / Phase Gate` — No explicit Phase Gate Checklist section. Footer says 'Phases: 13/14' but doesn't identify which phase was skipped or provide P2/P3 completion evidence.
5. [low] `Zero (#21)` — Description says 'Not included in the main PnL formula' but the column's purpose relative to downstream consumption is ambiguous — is it purely informational or expected to be used by consumers for adjusted reconciliation?

Tier 1 paraphrasing failures (must be fixed verbatim):

- **InstrumentID**:
  - Upstream: `Primary key identifying the tradeable instrument pair. Allocated by Trade.InstrumentAdd during instrument creation. Ranges from 0 (system placeholder) to ~21 million IDs allocated. Referenced by virtu`
  - You wrote: `Primary key identifying the tradeable instrument pair. Allocated by Trade.InstrumentAdd during instrument creation. Referenced by virtually every trading fact table and the Dim_Currency / Dim_HistoryS`
  - Loss: Dropped sentinel/range info ('Ranges from 0 (system placeholder) to ~21 million IDs allocated'). Injected non-upstream lineage text about passthrough mechanism.
- **InstrumentDisplayName**:
  - Upstream: `User-facing instrument display name from Trade.InstrumentMetaData. More descriptive than Name (e.g., 'Apple Inc.' vs 'Apple'). NULL for instruments without metadata entries.`
  - You wrote: `User-facing instrument display name from Trade.InstrumentMetaData. More descriptive than Name (e.g., 'Apple Inc.' vs 'Apple'). NULL for instruments without metadata entries. Passthrough from Dim_Instr`
  - Loss: Missed inheritance: dim-lookup passthrough should be Tier 1 with Dim_Instrument wiki description verbatim, but tagged as Tier 2. Added non-upstream text 'Passthrough from Dim_Instrument'.

Address every issue above. Do NOT regenerate the whole wiki from scratch — keep what was correct, only fix what the judge flagged.
