## 1. Business Meaning

This table is the **daily change log** for **CEP Rules** — the **top-level** entities in the CEP hedging rule engine. Each row records **one rule-level event** on business date **`Date`**: creation, deletion, activation/deactivation, rename, description edit, hedge-server reassignment, or **priority** reordering.

**Rule semantics (conceptual):** A rule has **`RuleName`**, **`Description`**, **`Priority`** (evaluation order — **lower numeric value = higher precedence**, with **0** evaluated first), **`HedgeServerID`** (which hedging backend stack processes the rule), and **`IsActive`**. Rules contain **compound properties (CPs)** and **conditions**; **this table only captures rule-shell changes**, not CP or condition internals (those live in sibling audit tables).

**Why it matters:** Rules **directly govern** how client positions are routed and hedged. Governance, post-incident review, and regulatory questions about **“what hedging policy looked like on date D”** lean on this trail. The table has the **richest `TypeOfChange` vocabulary** in the **CEPDailyAudit** family (**eight** distinct event types, including **Activated** / **Deactivated**).

**Scale (documented sample):** On the order of **~1,003 rows** from **2023-12-13** through **2026-03-09**. **No PII** in the sampled semantics.

**Cadence vs weekly:** **`Dealing_CEPWeeklyAudit_Rules`** holds a **weekly** rollup with history from **Sep 2021**; this **daily** table starts **Dec 2023** and offers **per-day** granularity for investigations after that cutover.

## 2. Business Logic

- **Writer:** `Dealing_dbo.SP_CEPDailyAudit(@Date)` — **DELETE + INSERT** for the target **`Date`** (same pattern as other **CEPDailyAudit** tables).
- **Sources:** Current rules from **`External_Etoro_CEP_Rules`** and temporal history from **`External_Etoro_History_Rules`**.
- **Change detection (high level):** **`LAG()`**-style comparisons detect **name**, **description**, **`IsActive`**, **`HedgeServerID`**, and **`Priority`** changes; **RN / RN_Desc** logic classifies **new rule** and **rule deleted** events (see SP for exact predicates).
- **`TypeOfChange`:** Derived strings such as **`New Rule`**, **`Rule Deleted`**, **`Activated`**, **`Deactivated`**, **`Name Change`**, **`Description Change`**, **`HedgeServerID Change`**, **`Priority Change`** — **exact spelling matters** in filters.
- **`Comments`:** For edits, carries **previous** values (e.g. **Previous Name**, **Previous Priority**) — use for **before/after** reconstructions.
- **`LoginName`:** **`COALESCE(AppLoginName, PreviousAppLoginName)`** so deletions still attribute an actor when the current row’s login is null.
- **`ChangeTime`:** **`SysStartTime`** for most paths; **`SysEndTime`** for deletions — **source event time**, not load time.
- **`UpdateDate`:** **`GETDATE()`** in the SP — **ETL metadata**.

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Distribution and indexing

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Distribution** | `ROUND_ROBIN` — appropriate for **low thousands** of rows. |
| **Clustered index** | **`Date` ASC** — align filters to **`Date`** for partition-style mental model and index seek. |
| **Scale** | Small — routine audit queries need **no special tuning**. |

### 3.2 Recommended patterns

- **`WHERE Date = @d`** for **daily** governance review.
- **`WHERE RuleID = @r ORDER BY Date, ChangeTime`** for **full rule timeline** after Dec 2023.
- Join siblings on **`RuleID`** and **`Date`** for **same-day** CP / CP-to-rule / condition context.

### 3.3 Freshness

- **ACTIVE** in documented sample; **max `Date` 2026-03-09**. Expect **next business day** availability for date *D* after the daily batch.

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **Multiple rows per `RuleID` per `Date`** are **valid** if several edits occurred the same calendar day.
- **`Description`** on **`Description Change`** rows holds the **new** text; **old** text is in **`Comments`**.
- **`Priority`** on **`Priority Change`** rows holds the **new** value; **old** is in **`Comments`**.
- Prefer **`ChangeTime`** / **`Date`** for **business timelines**; avoid treating **`UpdateDate`** as the event clock.

## 1. Business Meaning

This table records every **Compound Property (CP) lifecycle event** in eToro's CEP (Client Execution Platform) hedging rule engine. CPs are groupings of conditions used within CEP Rules — they act as logical "clauses" that can be reused across multiple hedging rules. When a CP is created, renamed, or deleted, one row is written for that business date.

**Source and lineage**: Data flows from `Dealing_staging.External_Etoro_CEP_CompoundProperties` (current state) and `External_Etoro_History_CompoundProperties` (temporal history). The writer SP `SP_CEPDailyAudit` uses `LAG()` window functions over system-time versioned records to detect changes, then classifies each event by type.

**Freshness**: Runs daily. Data available next business day. Active pipeline — max date 2026-03-09. Sparse table (314 rows since Dec 2023) because rows only appear on days when CP changes actually occur.

**Why it matters**: CEP rules control how eToro routes and hedges client positions. Changes to CPs can materially affect hedging behavior. This audit trail supports regulatory compliance, post-incident investigation, and governance oversight by the Dealing team.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Change Detection via Temporal Tables

**What**: The SP detects CP changes by comparing successive system-time versions of the staging temporal tables using `LAG()` over `SysStartTime`.

**Columns Involved**: `TypeOfChange`, `ChangeTime`, `LoginName`, `Comments`

**Rules**:
- `New Compound Property` — CP created today (new row in current table, no prior history)
- `Name Change` — CP renamed (Comments stores `"Previous Name: {oldName}"`)
- `Compound Property Deleted` — CP removed from CEP (row disappears from current, appears in history with SysEndTime)
- `LoginName` uses `COALESCE(AppLoginName, PreviousAppLoginName)` to capture the responsible user even for deletion events

### 2.2 Sentinel Row Pattern

**What**: The SP always writes at least one row per processed date, even if no CP changes occurred that day.

**Rules**:
- On days with no changes, a sentinel row with NULL `TypeOfChange`, `CompoundPropertyID`, etc. is written
- Filter with `WHERE TypeOfChange IS NOT NULL` for actual change events only

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is ROUND_ROBIN distributed with a CLUSTERED INDEX on `Date`. Very small table (~314 rows). No performance concerns. Always filter on `Date` for the most common access pattern.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

_Pending — resolved during write-objects._

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| What CP changes happened on date X? | `WHERE Date = 'YYYY-MM-DD' AND TypeOfChange IS NOT NULL` |
| Who made a specific CP change? | `WHERE CompoundPropertyID = @id AND TypeOfChange IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Date DESC` |
| All CP renames in a date range | `WHERE Date BETWEEN @start AND @end AND TypeOfChange = 'Name Change'` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Dealing_CEPDailyAudit_CPToRule | `CompoundPropertyID + Date` | Correlate CP changes with Rule-mapping changes on the same day |
| Dealing_CEPDailyAudit_Rules | `RuleID + Date` | See which Rule was affected by this CP change |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **Sparse table**: Many calendar dates have zero rows (no CP changes). Don't expect continuous daily data.
- **Sentinel rows**: Always filter `WHERE TypeOfChange IS NOT NULL` to exclude placeholder rows.
- This is one of 7 CEPDailyAudit tables, all written by the same SP: CP, CPToRule, ConditionToCP, Conditions, ListCIDMapping, NameLists, Rules.

## 1. Business Meaning

This table tracks **condition definition changes** in the **CEP (Client Execution Platform)** hedging rule engine. A **condition** is the atomic unit of rule logic: a **`Property OPERATOR Value`** expression that evaluates client trade or position attributes.

**What each row means:** On business date **`Date`**, a condition’s **property type**, **comparison operator**, or **threshold value** changed — or a condition was **created** or **deleted**. Use this table to answer: *“What exactly changed in a CEP rule condition on date X?”*

**Condition anatomy (ETL-resolved):**

- **`Property`** — attribute under test (e.g. instrument type, position size). Names come from **`External_Etoro_Dictionary_ConditionProperties`**.
- **`Operator`** — comparison (e.g. equals, greater than). Names from **`External_Etoro_Dictionary_ConditionOperators`**.
- **`Value`** — threshold or target, stored as **`varchar(100)`** to hold numeric, string, or enum-like literals.

**CEP hierarchy (conceptual):**

```
Rule
  └── Compound Property (CP)
        └── Condition   ← definition changes audited here
              └── Property + Operator + Value
```

**Why it matters:** Conditions encode the **business logic** of hedging rules. A **`Value Change`** or **`Operator Change`** can change **which trades** trigger hedging. This audit supports **replay**, **governance**, and **incident analysis** with **user** and **timestamp** attribution.

**Scale (documented sample):** About **3,189 rows** from **2023-12-12** through **2026-03-09**. **Higher churn** than **Condition-to-CP** mapping alone — attribute edits are common.

**Load pattern:** **`Dealing_dbo.SP_CEPDailyAudit`** performs **DELETE + INSERT** for the supplied **`@Date`**. **Daily** refresh (OpsDB / Service Broker **Priority 0**). **SLA:** typically **next business day** for date *D*.

## 2. Business Logic

- **Sources:** **`Dealing_staging.External_Etoro_CEP_Conditions`** (current) and **`External_Etoro_History_Conditions`** (temporal history); dictionary joins to **`External_Etoro_Dictionary_ConditionProperties`** and **`External_Etoro_Dictionary_ConditionOperators`**.
- **Change detection:** **`LAG()`**-style comparisons in the SP detect **property**, **operator**, and **value** transitions; events are classified as **`Property Change`**, **`Operator Change`**, **`Value Change`**, **`New Condition`**, **`Condition Deleted`** (exact strings from SP).
- **`RuleID` / `RuleName` / `HedgeServerID`:** Resolved through the **condition → CP → rule** chain (e.g. **`#Dim_ConditionRule`** style logic in SP) — attribution can be **non-trivial** when wiring spans multiple rules.
- **`Comments`:** For change events, carries the **previous** property, operator, or value (e.g. `"Previous Value: {old}"`); **NULL** for pure create/delete rows.
- **`LoginName`:** **`COALESCE(AppLoginName, PreviousAppLoginName)`** from the temporal source — **CEP application user**.
- **`ChangeTime`:** **`SysStartTime`** (and analogous semantics per SP path) — **source event time**.
- **`UpdateDate`:** **`GETDATE()`** in the SP — **ETL metadata**, not business time.

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Distribution and indexing

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Distribution** | `ROUND_ROBIN` — appropriate for **small** audit fact tables. |
| **Clustered index** | **`Date` ASC** — aligns with **daily** reload and **`WHERE Date = @d`** filters. |
| **Scale** | **Low thousands** of rows — routine analytics do not require special tuning. |

### 3.2 Recommended patterns

- Filter **`WHERE Date = @d`** for **daily** investigations.
- Filter **`WHERE ConditionID = @cid`** (often with **`Date`**) for **single-condition** timelines.
- Join **`RuleID`** / context to **`Dealing_CEPDailyAudit_CPToRule`** and **`Dealing_CEPDailyAudit_ConditionToCP`** for **full rule wiring**.

### 3.3 Freshness

- **ACTIVE** in documented window; **max `Date` 2026-03-09**. Expect **one batch row set per calendar date** processed by the SP.

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **`TypeOfChange`** values are **fixed literals** — match **case and spacing** in predicates.
- **`Value`** is **varchar** — cast or compare carefully when treating as numeric.
- **`Property`** and **`Operator`** are **human-readable** at load time — not raw IDs in this table.
- Multiple **change types** for the **same `ConditionID`** on the **same `Date`** can occur if several attributes changed.

# Dealing_dbo.Dealing_CEPDailyAudit_ConditionToCP

## 1. Business Meaning

This table captures **Condition → Compound Property (CP)** membership changes in the **Client Execution Platform (CEP)** hedging rule engine. **Conditions** are the **atomic predicates** (e.g. comparisons on instrument or account attributes) that, when grouped, define what must hold true for a **compound property** to “fire” inside a **rule**.

**CEP hierarchy (conceptual):**

```
Rule
  └── Compound Property (CP)   [linked via CPToRule]
        └── Condition           [linked via ConditionToCP]  ← audited here
              └── Property + Operator + Value (see Conditions audit table)
```

**What each row means:** On business date **`Date`**, a **condition** was **linked to** or **unlinked from** a **CP**. That changes **which atomic tests** participate in the CP’s bundle — and therefore **which client/trade facts** can satisfy the CP under a rule.

**Why it matters:** Unexpected hedging or routing behavior often traces to **“someone added/removed a condition from the CP we thought was stable.”** This audit gives Dealing and Risk a **replayable history** of those edits with **user attribution** and **timestamps**.

**Scale (sampled):** On the order of **~1,219 rows** from **2023-12-12** through **2026-03-09** — **lower churn** than CP-to-Rule mapping (which can rewire CPs across many rules frequently). **No PII.**

**Load pattern:** `SP_CEPDailyAudit` **DELETE + INSERT** per **`@Date`** for this table, same as siblings. **Daily** OpsDB / Service Broker schedule; **SLA** — typically **next business day** availability for date *D*.

## 2. Business Logic

- **Sources:** `Dealing_staging.External_Etoro_CEP_ConditionToCompoundProperty` (**current**) and `External_Etoro_History_ConditionToCompoundProperty` (**temporal history**).
- **Add vs remove detection:** If the **start** of the temporal row’s validity lands on **`@Date`**, classify **`Condition Added To CP`**; if the **end** date aligns with **`@Date`**, classify **`Condition Removed from CP`** (see SP for exact `SysStartDate` / `SysEndDate` logic).
- **Rule context (`RuleID`, `RuleName`, `HedgeServerID`):** Resolved by joining through **`#Dim_CPtoRule`** (built from CP-to-rule logs and rules logs). **Important:** If a CP is attached to **multiple rules**, the **same underlying condition membership change** can appear as **multiple rows** — one **per rule context** — mirroring how the dimension explodes for reporting.
- **`CP_Name`:** From **`#CPLog`** “latest state” style resolution — human-readable CP label for the `CompoundPropertyID` on the event.
- **`LoginName`:** `COALESCE(AppLoginName, PreviousAppLoginName)` — **CEP application user**.
- **`ChangeTime`:** **`SysStartTime`** for additions; removals align with **`SysEndTime`** semantics in SP — **source event time**.
- **`UpdateDate`:** **`GETDATE()`** in the SP — **ETL metadata**.

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Distribution and indexing

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Distribution** | `ROUND_ROBIN` — fine for small audit tables. |
| **Clustered index** | **`Date` ASC** — matches primary access path. |
| **Scale** | **Low thousands** of rows in sample window — no tuning required for routine queries. |

### 3.2 Recommended patterns

- **`WHERE Date = @d`** for daily investigations.
- Join to **`Dealing_CEPDailyAudit_Conditions`** on **`ConditionID`** (and often **`Date`**) to pull **property/operator/value** semantics for the condition that moved.
- Join to **`Dealing_CEPDailyAudit_CP`** / **`CPToRule`** to place the change in **full rule context**.

### 3.3 Freshness

- **ACTIVE**; sampled **max `Date` 2026-03-09**. Treat as **daily** batch aligned to **`@Date`**.

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **Fan-out across rules** — **not all duplicates are errors**; verify whether multiple rows for one `ConditionID` + `Date` are explained by **multi-rule CP attachment**.
- **`TypeOfChange` values** are **exact strings** from SP: `Condition Added To CP`, `Condition Removed from CP` — case and spacing matter in filters.
- Compare volume to **`Dealing_CEPDailyAudit_CPToRule`** — **lower here** is **expected** if **condition bundles** change less often than **CP-to-rule wiring**.

## 1. Business Meaning

This is the **highest-volume** table in the CEPDailyAudit family (~32K rows vs ~300–3K for sibling tables). It records every time a Compound Property is added to a Rule, removed from a Rule, or has its `IsTrue` boolean polarity toggled within a rule's logic.

**Source and lineage**: Data flows from `Dealing_staging.External_Etoro_CEP_CompoundPropertyToRule` (current state) and `External_Etoro_History_CompoundPropertyToRule` (temporal history). The writer SP `SP_CEPDailyAudit` uses `LAG()` window functions to detect state changes, then classifies each event.

**Freshness**: Runs daily. Active pipeline — max date 2026-03-09. 32,274 rows since Dec 2023 — high volume confirms frequent CP-to-Rule reconfiguration activity by the Dealing team.

**Why it matters**: CP-to-Rule mappings define which compound property "clauses" are active in each hedging rule. Changing these mappings directly affects eToro's order routing and hedging behavior. This audit trail supports post-incident investigation, governance oversight, and regulatory compliance.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Change Detection and Event Classification

**What**: The SP detects CP-to-Rule mapping changes by comparing successive system-time versions using `LAG()`.

**Columns Involved**: `TypeOfChange`, `IsTrue`, `ChangeTime`, `LoginName`

**Rules**:
- `CP Added to Rule` — CP newly mapped to a rule
- `CP Removed from Rule` — CP removed from a rule
- `Mapping Changed from Not True to True` — IsTrue flipped 0→1
- `Mapping Changed from True to Not True` — IsTrue flipped 1→0
- `LoginName` uses `COALESCE(AppLoginName, PreviousAppLoginName)` to capture identity even for removal events

### 2.2 IsTrue Polarity

**What**: Controls whether the CP must evaluate as true or false within the rule's logic.

**Columns Involved**: `IsTrue`

**Rules**:
- `IsTrue = 1` — the CP clause must be satisfied (evaluate true) to match the rule
- `IsTrue = 0` — the CP clause must NOT be satisfied — effectively an exclusion clause
- Polarity toggles are tracked as distinct `TypeOfChange` events

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is ROUND_ROBIN distributed with a CLUSTERED INDEX on `Date`. Moderate size (~32K rows). ROUND_ROBIN appropriate for an audit/log table with no natural join key.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

_Pending — resolved during write-objects._

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| What CP-to-Rule changes happened on date X? | `WHERE Date = 'YYYY-MM-DD'` |
| Which CPs were added to a specific rule? | `WHERE RuleID = @id AND TypeOfChange = 'CP Added to Rule'` |
| All IsTrue polarity toggles in a range | `WHERE Date BETWEEN @start AND @end AND TypeOfChange LIKE 'Mapping Changed%'` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Dealing_CEPDailyAudit_CP | `CompoundPropertyID + Date` | Correlate CP property changes with mapping changes on the same day |
| Dealing_CEPDailyAudit_Rules | `RuleID + Date` | See rule-level changes alongside mapping changes |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **Highest volume** of all CEPDailyAudit tables — CP-to-Rule mappings change more frequently than the entities themselves
- A single CP can be mapped to many rules, so one CP change can generate multiple CPToRule rows
- `IsTrue` semantic is counterintuitive: `IsTrue=0` doesn't mean "inactive" — it means "CP must NOT be true" (exclusion logic)
- This is one of 7 CEPDailyAudit tables, all written by the same SP

> Daily audit of **CID ↔ Named List** membership changes in CEP — each row is an **add** or **remove** of a **client ID** from a **Named List** used in hedging rule conditions.

## 1. Business Meaning

This table tracks **CID-to–Named List mapping changes** in the **Client Execution Platform (CEP)**. **Named Lists** are configuration objects holding **sets of client IDs (CIDs)** that rules can reference — for example, **include** or **exclude** specific clients from a hedging path.

**PII:** The **`CID`** column is a **direct client identifier**. This is the **CEP Daily Audit** table family member with **explicit PII**. Apply **data governance**, **access controls**, and **masking** policies consistent with **client-level** DWH objects.

**What each row means:** On business date **`Date`**, a **CID** was **added to** or **removed from** a **Named List**. Together with **`Dealing_CEPDailyAudit_NameLists`**, it forms the audit trail for **client-scoped** CEP configuration.

**Why it matters:** List membership changes can **change hedging or routing** for **individual clients**. Typical uses:

- **Compliance** — when was client **X** added or removed from list **Y**?
- **Client services** — explain behavior tied to **list membership**.
- **Risk / Dealing oversight** — review **who** changed **which** list and **when**.

**Activity note (documented sample):** About **532 rows** from **2023-12-19** through **2026-01-26**. **Sparse** activity is **expected** — the SP writes rows **only on days** when membership changes occur; many calendar days may have **zero** rows. **Last row date** lagging the documentation date does **not** by itself imply pipeline failure.

**Load pattern:** **`Dealing_dbo.SP_CEPDailyAudit`** — **DELETE + INSERT** for **`@Date`**. **Daily** batch (OpsDB / Service Broker). **SLA:** typically **next business day**.

## 2. Business Logic

- **Sources:** **`Dealing_staging.External_Etoro_CEP_ListCIDMappings`** (current) and **`External_Etoro_History_ListCIDMappings`** (temporal history).
- **Add vs remove:** When temporal **`SysStartDate = @Date`** → **`CID Added`**; when **`SysEndDate = @Date`** and the row is **closed** (non-sentinel end) → **`CID Deleted`** — see SP for exact **`SysEndTime`** handling.
- **`ListName`:** Resolved from **`#NameLists_Log`** (latest name by list id) — may reflect **current** naming even if the list was **renamed** after the mapping event; analysts should cross-check **`NameLists`** audit for **rename** history.
- **`LoginName`:** **`COALESCE(AppLoginName, PreviousAppLoginName)`** — **CEP user** performing the change.
- **`ChangeTime`:** **`SysStartTime`** / **`SysEndTime`** depending on add vs remove path.
- **`UpdateDate`:** **`GETDATE()`** — **ETL metadata**.

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Distribution and indexing

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Distribution** | `ROUND_ROBIN`. |
| **Clustered index** | **`Date` ASC** — primary slice for **daily** audit pulls. |
| **Scale** | **Hundreds** of rows in documented history — **full scans** on **`CID`** filters are still **cheap**, but **always apply PII policies** before exporting results. |

### 3.2 Recommended patterns

- **`WHERE Date = @d`** for **daily** reconciliation.
- **`WHERE CID = @cid`** for **client-centric** history (**governed** access only).
- Join **`NameListID`** / **`ListName`** to **`Dealing_CEPDailyAudit_NameLists`** on **`Date`** when correlating **list-level** events with **per-CID** rows.

### 3.3 Freshness

- Pipeline **runs daily**; **row count** grows only on **change days**. Use **OpsDB / job** status — not row **recency** alone — to confirm health.

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **`TypeOfChange`** values: **`CID Added`**, **`CID Deleted`** — **exact** string match.
- **Low row volume** vs calendar span is **normal**.
- **PII** — never use this table in **self-service** extracts without **approval**.

## 4. Elements

### Confidence Tier Legend

| Stars | Tier | Tag |
|-------|------|-----|
| ★★★ | Tier 2 — SP code | `(Tier 2 — SP_CEPDailyAudit)` |
| ★ | Tier 4 — inferred | `[UNVERIFIED] (Tier 4 — inferred)` |

| # | Element | Type | Nullable | Description |
|---|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Date | date | YES | **Business date** of the CID mapping change — **`@Date`** for the SP partition. (Tier 2 — SP_CEPDailyAudit) |
| 2 | NameListID | int | YES | **Named List** identifier whose membership changed. (Tier 2 — SP_CEPDailyAudit) |
| 3 | ListName | varchar(max) | YES | **Human-readable list name** (from **`#NameLists_Log`**) for analyst-friendly reporting. (Tier 2 — SP_CEPDailyAudit) |
| 4 | CID | bigint | YES | **Client ID** added or removed — **PII**; join to **customer / account** dimensions only under **governance**. (Tier 2 — SP_CEPDailyAudit) |
| 5 | TypeOfChange | varchar(max) | YES | **`CID Added`** or **`CID Deleted`**. (Tier 2 — SP_CEPDailyAudit) |
| 6 | LoginName | varchar(max) | YES | **CEP application user** who performed the add/remove. (Tier 2 — SP_CEPDailyAudit) |
| 7 | ChangeTime | datetime | YES | **Exact source timestamp** of the mapping event. (Tier 2 — SP_CEPDailyAudit) |
| 8 | UpdateDate | datetime | YES | **DWH load time** via **`GETDATE()`** — **not** business event time. [UNVERIFIED] (Tier 4 — inferred) |

## 5. Lineage

ETL flow (detail in **`.lineage.md`**):

```
[CEP System — ListCIDMappings temporal table]
    ↓
Dealing_staging.External_Etoro_CEP_ListCIDMappings  (current)
Dealing_staging.External_Etoro_History_ListCIDMappings  (history)
    ↓ JOIN #NameLists_Log (list name)
SP_CEPDailyAudit(@Date)
    — SysStartDate / SysEndDate logic → CID Added / CID Deleted
    ↓
Dealing_dbo.Dealing_CEPDailyAudit_ListCIDMapping  ← DELETE + INSERT for @Date
```

**Column lineage (summary):** `Date` ← `@Date`; `NameListID`, `CID`, `LoginName`, `ChangeTime` ← list-CID external / history; `ListName` ← **`#NameLists_Log`**; `TypeOfChange` ← temporal classification; `UpdateDate` ← `GETDATE()`.

## 6. Relationships

| Object | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| `Dealing_dbo.Dealing_CEPDailyAudit_NameLists` | **List definition** and **list-level** **`Change In CIDs`** events — companion to **per-CID** rows here. |
| `Dealing_dbo.Dealing_CEPDailyAudit_CP` | **CP** configuration may **reference** Named Lists in **conditions** — trace upward for **full rule** context. |
| `Dealing_staging.External_Etoro_CEP_ListCIDMappings` | **Current** membership **source**. |
| `Dealing_staging.External_Etoro_History_ListCIDMappings` | **Temporal** **history** **source**. |
| `Dealing_dbo.Dealing_CEPWeeklyAudit_ListCIDMapping` | **Weekly rollup** of the same events. |
