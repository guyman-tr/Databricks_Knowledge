## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Dim_Instrument` is the DWH's master reference for all tradeable instruments on the eToro platform. It extends the foundational trade pair definition from `Trade.Instrument` (which specifies the buy/sell currency pairing for each instrument) with rich analytics metadata: display names and company info from `Trade.InstrumentMetaData`, trading configuration from `Trade.ProviderToInstrument`, financial market data (market cap, ADV, shares outstanding) from the Rankings/StockInfo system, Bloomberg-style asset classification, and futures-specific parameters. The result is a 47-column analytics hub that serves as the primary instrument lookup for fact table enrichment across DWH analytics.

The production source is `etoro.Trade.GetInstrument` (a view on the production etoroDB-REAL server), which combines `Trade.Instrument` with multiple related tables. The Generic Pipeline exports this view daily to `Bronze/etoro/Trade/GetInstrument/` (UC: `trading.bronze_etoro_trade_getinstrument`). The DWH ETL SP (`SP_Dim_Instrument`) then joins this staging data with six additional staging tables to produce the full 47-column Dim_Instrument. Post-load UPDATE statements enrich price-server tracking, asset classification, and financial fundamentals. Source: upstream wiki available at `Trade/Tables/Trade.Instrument.md` (quality 9.1/10).

The ETL is a full TRUNCATE + INSERT + multiple UPDATEs, running daily with a `@dt` date parameter. `UpdateDate` and `InsertDate` are both set to `GETDATE()` at load time and do NOT reflect production modification times. The SP ends by calling `SP_Dim_Instrument_Snapshot @dt` to update the `Dim_Instrument_Snapshot` table (daily snapshot of futures configuration columns). As of 2026-03-19, the table contains 15,707 rows: 82% Stocks, 8% ETFs, 4% Crypto, 3% Commodities, 2% Indices, 1% Currencies.

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Buy/Sell Currency Pairing

**What**: Every instrument is defined as a pair of assets from `Dictionary.Currency`/`Dim_Currency`. The pairing determines how prices are quoted, how positions are settled, and how P&L is converted to account currency.

**Columns Involved**: `BuyCurrencyID`, `SellCurrencyID`, `BuyCurrency`, `SellCurrency`

**Rules**:
- For **forex pairs**: BuyCurrencyID is the base currency, SellCurrencyID is the quote currency (e.g., InstrumentID=1: EUR/USD = BuyCurrencyID=2/EUR, SellCurrencyID=1/USD)
- For **stocks/ETFs/crypto**: BuyCurrencyID equals the asset's own InstrumentID in Dim_Currency, and SellCurrencyID is the denomination currency (USD for US stocks, EUR for European stocks, GBX for UK pence-quoted stocks)
- `BuyCurrency` and `SellCurrency` are DWH-added text abbreviations (denormalized from Dictionary.Currency via SP JOIN)
- InstrumentID=0: system/ETL null-sentinel record with all zero/NA values

**Diagram**:
```
Forex:  ID=1  -> Buy=EUR(2)  / Sell=USD(1)   = EUR/USD pair
Stock:  ID=1001 -> Buy=AAPL(1001) / Sell=USD(1) = Apple in USD
EuroSt: ID=1203 -> Buy=Bayer(1203) / Sell=EUR(2) = Bayer AG in EUR
Crypto: ID=XXXX -> Buy=BTC(?) / Sell=USD(1)     = Bitcoin in USD
```

### 2.2 InstrumentType and IsMajor Dual Representation

**What**: Two DWH-specific computed/reformatted columns encode enum values as human-readable text.

**Columns Involved**: `InstrumentTypeID`, `InstrumentType`, `IsMajorID`, `IsMajor`

**Rules**:
- `InstrumentType` is CASE-computed in the SP from `InstrumentTypeID`: 1=Currencies, 2=Commodities, 4=Indices, 5=Stocks, 6=ETF, 10=Crypto Currencies, else=Other. Note: type IDs 3, 7, 8, 9 are not defined (gap exists for historical reasons)
- `IsMajorID` = production `IsMajor` bit value (0 or 1). `IsMajor` = text version ('Yes' or 'No'). Analysts should use `IsMajorID` for filtering, `IsMajor` for display
- IsMajor=Yes: 6,963 instruments (major forex + popular stocks/ETFs). IsMajor=No: 8,743 instruments
- DWHInstrumentID always equals InstrumentID (redundant copy, same as the DWHXxxID pattern across all DWH Dim tables)
- StatusID is hardcoded to 1 for all real rows (ETL artifact; NULL only for ID=0 placeholder)

### 2.3 IsFuture Derivation and Futures Columns

**What**: Futures instruments are identified by membership in InstrumentGroups(GroupID=25), and carry additional configuration columns not present for non-futures instruments.

**Columns Involved**: `IsFuture`, `Multiplier`, `ProviderMarginPerLot`, `eToroMarginPerLot`, `SettlementTime`

**Rules**:
- `IsFuture = 1` when the instrument is a member of `DWH_staging.etoro_Trade_InstrumentGroups` with `GroupID=25`. Computed via CASE in SP_Dim_Instrument.
- `Multiplier`: contract size multiplier from `Trade.FuturesMetaData`. NULL for non-futures.
- `ProviderMarginPerLot`: initial margin requirement from the liquidity provider, from `Trade.FuturesInstrumentsInitialMarginByProviderMapping`. NULL for non-futures.
- `eToroMarginPerLot`: eToro's own margin per lot (in asset currency) from `Trade.ProviderToInstrument.InitialMarginInAssetCurrency`. NULL for non-futures.
- `SettlementTime`: daily/weekly settlement time from `Trade.ProviderToInstrument`, formatted as TIME(0) by the SP.

### 2.4 Financial Fundamentals (Post-Load Updates)

**What**: Market data columns are populated via post-load UPDATE statements joining to the Rankings/StockInfo data lake.

**Columns Involved**: `ADV_Last3Months`, `MKTcap`, `SharesOutStanding`, `AssetClass`, `IndustryGroup`, `PlatformSector`, `PlatformIndustry`

**Rules**:
- `ADV_Last3Months`: Average Daily Volume over last 3 months (MetadataID=8557). NULL for non-stock instruments or instruments without Rankings data.
- `MKTcap`: Market Capitalization in USD (MetadataID=8735 for stocks, fallback to MetadataID=9315 CryptoMarketCap for crypto). NULL if not covered by Rankings.
- `SharesOutStanding`: Total shares outstanding in units (MetadataID=8444). Stocks only.
- `AssetClass` / `IndustryGroup`: Bloomberg-style classification from `Ext_Dim_Instrument_Classification_Static`. More granular than InstrumentType.
- `PlatformSector` / `PlatformIndustry`: eToro platform taxonomy (MetadataID=8436/8280), may differ from Bloomberg AssetClass/IndustryGroup.
- `ReceivedOnPriceServer`: First date/time an instrument was seen on the price server. POST-LOAD from `Ext_Dim_Instrument_ReceivedOnPriceServerStatic`. NULL for instruments not yet priced.

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed (all 15,707 rows available on every compute node) with a CLUSTERED INDEX on `InstrumentID`. Since virtually every fact table JOINs to `Dim_Instrument` on `InstrumentID`, replication eliminates shuffle overhead. The clustered index supports range scans and direct lookups efficiently.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, the Gold export is pending write-objects configuration. At 15,707 rows, partitioning is not beneficial -- suggest Z-ORDER on `InstrumentID` for join performance, and `InstrumentTypeID` for type-filtered analytics.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Get instrument name and type by ID | `JOIN Dim_Instrument ON InstrumentID; SELECT Name, InstrumentType` |
| Find all major instruments by asset class | `WHERE IsMajorID = 1 AND AssetClass = 'Technology'` |
| Find instruments eligible for long/short | `WHERE AllowBuy = 1 AND AllowSell = 1 AND Tradable = 1` |
| Get market cap for a position | `JOIN Dim_Instrument ON InstrumentID; SELECT MKTcap` |
| Find futures instruments with settlement | `WHERE IsFuture = 1 AND SettlementTime IS NOT NULL` |
| Find US stocks with ISIN | `WHERE InstrumentTypeID = 5 AND ISINCountryCode = 'US' AND ISINCode IS NOT NULL` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Currency | `ON Dim_Currency.CurrencyID = Dim_Instrument.BuyCurrencyID` | Resolve buy-side currency/asset details |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Currency | `ON Dim_Currency.CurrencyID = Dim_Instrument.SellCurrencyID` | Resolve sell-side denomination currency |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_HistorySplitRatio | `ON InstrumentID + date range` | Get split adjustment ratios for historical price normalization |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Instrument_Snapshot | `ON InstrumentID + DateID` | Get point-in-time futures config for historical analysis |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_CurrencyPriceWithSplit | `ON InstrumentID` | Join to price history |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **InstrumentID=0 is the null-sentinel placeholder**: All fields are 0/NA/NULL. Always filter `WHERE InstrumentID > 0` for analytics.
- **DWHInstrumentID always equals InstrumentID**: This is a redundant copy column -- do not use it as a distinct identifier.
- **StatusID is hardcoded 1**: This column conveys no information (all rows = 1 except the ID=0 placeholder). Do not filter on it.
- **UpdateDate and InsertDate are both ETL timestamps**: Neither reflects when the instrument was created or last modified in production. They reflect the last ETL run (daily, ~midnight).
- **InstrumentType gaps**: TypeIDs 3, 7, 8, 9 are not used. The CASE expression returns 'Other' for any unmapped typeID.
- **IsMajorID vs IsMajor**: Use `IsMajorID` (int 0/1) for WHERE/GROUP BY. Use `IsMajor` ('Yes'/'No') for display only.
- **NULL fundamentals**: ADV_Last3Months, MKTcap, SharesOutStanding are NULL for non-stock instruments and for instruments not covered by Rankings data. Always use LEFT JOIN or ISNULL() when using these for aggregations.
- **AllowBuy/AllowSell = 0 means trading disabled**: Instruments with AllowBuy=0 cannot be opened in the specified direction. This changes dynamically in production but is updated daily in DWH.
- **Dim_Instrument vs Dim_Currency**: Dim_Currency (from Dictionary.Currency) is the master asset registry with type and currency info. Dim_Instrument (from Trade.Instrument) is the trading pair definition with full analytics enrichment. For basic instrument lookups, Dim_Currency suffices. For trading parameters, fundamentals, or pair analysis, use Dim_Instrument.
