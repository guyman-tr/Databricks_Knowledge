## 1. Business Meaning

`Dim_Currency` is the **universal instrument registry** for the eToro DWH. Despite its misleading name (inherited from eToro's origins as a forex-only platform), it contains every tradeable asset on the platform: 13,044 stocks, 1,094 ETFs, 686 crypto assets, 533 commodities, 203 indices, and 174 forex pairs - 15,734 rows total as of 2026-03-11.

`CurrencyID` is the platform-wide instrument identifier. It is referenced by virtually every fact table in the DWH: trade positions, deposits, credit events, and cost history all use CurrencyID to identify the instrument involved. Joining to Dim_Currency decodes CurrencyID into instrument name, asset class (CurrencyTypeID), and trading properties.

The ETL is a full TRUNCATE+INSERT daily reload from `DWH_staging.etoro_Dictionary_Currency`. All 9 source columns are passthroughs; only UpdateDate is ETL-computed. The DWH has more rows than the upstream wiki documents (15.7K vs 10.7K upstream) because the wiki was written earlier and the platform has added more instruments since.

Upstream wiki: `DB_Schema/etoro/Wiki/Dictionary/Tables/Dictionary.Currency.md` (quality 9+/10, VERIFIED confidence).

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Instrument Classification by Asset Class

**What**: CurrencyTypeID classifies every instrument into one of 6 asset classes, determining trading rules, leverage limits, and settlement options.

**Columns Involved**: `CurrencyTypeID`

**DWH distribution (live 2026-03-11)**:
```
CurrencyTypeID=5 (Stocks):     13,044 rows (83%)
CurrencyTypeID=6 (ETF):         1,094 rows (7%)
CurrencyTypeID=10 (Crypto):       686 rows (4%)
CurrencyTypeID=2 (Commodity):     533 rows (3%)
CurrencyTypeID=4 (Indices):       203 rows (1%)
CurrencyTypeID=1 (Forex):         174 rows (1%)
```

**Rules**:
- Stocks (5): Individual company shares. Can trade as REAL (1x) or CFD.
- ETF (6): Exchange-traded funds. Similar rules to stocks.
- Crypto (10): Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. ESMA max 2x retail leverage. Can be REAL at 1x.
- Commodity (2): Gold, Oil, Silver, etc. Always CFD. ESMA max 10x retail.
- Forex (1): Currency pairs. Always CFD. ESMA max 30x (majors) / 20x (minors).
- Indices (4): S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc. Always CFD. ESMA max 20x retail.

### 2.2 Bitmask System (Legacy Forex)

**What**: The Mask column encodes forex instrument identity as power-of-2 bitmasks for legacy system compatibility.

**Columns Involved**: `Mask`

**Rules**:
- USD=1 (2^0), EUR=2 (2^1), GBP=4 (2^2), JPY=8 (2^3), AUD=16 (2^4), CHF=32 (2^5), CAD=64 (2^6), NZD=128 (2^7)
- Only meaningful for the original 8 major forex currencies. Stocks, crypto, commodities have NULL or 0.
- Hard ceiling of 31 instruments (INT bitmask limit) - now exceeded, so not used for newer assets.

### 2.3 EEA Stock Exchange Compliance (MiFID II)

**What**: Flags instruments listed on European Economic Area exchanges requiring KID documents under PRIIPs regulation.

**Columns Involved**: `EEAStockExchange`

**Rules**:
- EEAStockExchange=1 for ~216 instruments on EU/EEA exchanges (London, Frankfurt, Paris, etc.)
- These require KID (Key Information Document) availability for retail EU clients
- Affects instrument availability for EU-regulated users

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, REPLICATE with 15.7K rows is appropriate. The CLUSTERED INDEX on CurrencyID supports fast point lookups. At this row count, the table is small enough to broadcast to all nodes efficiently.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, store as Delta (MANAGED), no partitioning needed (15.7K rows). Z-ORDER BY CurrencyID optional.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Decode instrument ID in a fact | `JOIN DWH_dbo.Dim_Currency d ON f.CurrencyID = d.CurrencyID` |
| Filter stocks only | `WHERE CurrencyTypeID = 5` |
| Find a specific instrument by ticker | `WHERE Abbreviation = 'AAPL.US'` |
| List EEA instruments | `WHERE EEAStockExchange = 1` |
| Exclude CurrencyID=0 (placeholder) | `WHERE CurrencyID > 0` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| All DWH fact tables | ON f.CurrencyID = d.CurrencyID | Decode instrument for any trade/position/cost fact |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Country | ON c.DefaultCurrencyID = d.CurrencyID | Default account currency per country [UNVERIFIED - DefaultCurrencyID dropped from Dim_Country] |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **Naming is misleading**: This is NOT just currencies. 83% of rows are stocks. Always filter by CurrencyTypeID when intent is asset-class-specific.
- CurrencyID=0 is a placeholder ("NULL instrument"). Exclude with `WHERE CurrencyID > 0` for business analytics.
- Mask is NULL/0 for all non-forex instruments. Do not use Mask for asset identification outside legacy forex systems.
- DWH has 15.7K rows; upstream production wiki shows 10.7K - the platform has added ~5K instruments since the wiki was written. Row count grows over time.
- Name is `varchar(50)` - many stock names are verbose (e.g., "United States of America, US Dollar"). Use Abbreviation for tickers.

| 4 | Abbreviation | varchar(20) | NO | Ticker symbol. "USD", "EUR" for forex; "AAPL.US", "TSLA.US" for US stocks (format: TICKER.EXCHANGE); "BTC" for crypto. Unique across all instruments. Use this for human-readable instrument identification. (Tier 1 - Dictionary.Currency upstream wiki) |
| 5 | Mask | int | YES | Legacy power-of-2 bitmask for original 8 major forex currencies (USD=1, EUR=2, GBP=4, JPY=8, AUD=16, CHF=32, CAD=64, NZD=128). NULL or 0 for all stocks, crypto, commodities, indices. Only used in legacy forex calculations. (Tier 1 - Dictionary.Currency upstream wiki) |
| 6 | EEAStockExchange | bit | NO | Whether this instrument is listed on a European Economic Area exchange, requiring KID documents under MiFID II PRIIPs regulation. 1=EEA-listed (~216 instruments), 0=not EEA-listed. Affects instrument availability for retail EU users. (Tier 1 - Dictionary.Currency upstream wiki) |
| 7 | ISINCode | varchar(25) | YES | International Securities Identification Number (12-char: 2-char country + 9-char ticker + check digit). Available for stocks and ETFs. NULL for forex, commodities, crypto, and indices. Used for regulatory reporting and cross-system integration. (Tier 1 - Dictionary.Currency upstream wiki) |
| 8 | CurrencySymbol | nchar(5) | YES | Display symbol for the instrument (e.g., "$" for USD, "€" for EUR, "£" for GBP, "₿" for BTC). NULL for most stocks and commodities. nchar type supports Unicode symbols. (Tier 2 - SP passthrough; live data confirms) |
| 9 | InterestRateID | int | YES | FK to an interest rate configuration for this instrument. Used for overnight financing rates on leveraged positions. NULL for most instruments. (Tier 2 - SP passthrough; live data confirms for major forex) |
| 10 | UpdateDate | datetime | NO | ETL load timestamp. Set to GETDATE() on each daily full reload by SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse. Reflects ETL run time, not source data change time. (Tier 2 - SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse) |

### 5.2 ETL Pipeline

```
etoro.Dictionary.Currency
  -> [Generic Pipeline]
  -> DWH_staging.etoro_Dictionary_Currency (HEAP, ROUND_ROBIN)
  -> DWH_dbo.SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse (TRUNCATE + INSERT, GETDATE() for UpdateDate)
  -> DWH_dbo.Dim_Currency (15.7K rows)
```

| Step | Object | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Source | etoro.Dictionary.Currency | Master instrument registry. All 6 asset classes. Audit-triggered with History.AuditHistory in production. |
| Staging | DWH_staging.etoro_Dictionary_Currency | Raw staging. Same column structure. |
| ETL | DWH_dbo.SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse | TRUNCATE + INSERT. All 9 columns passthrough. Injects GETDATE() for UpdateDate. |
| Target | DWH_dbo.Dim_Currency | Final DWH instrument dimension (15.7K rows) |

**Note**: The upstream production table has audit triggers (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE -> History.AuditHistory). DWH does not replicate this audit trail.
