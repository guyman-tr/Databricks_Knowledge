## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Fact_BillingDeposit` is the DWH's authoritative record of every deposit attempt on the eToro platform — approved, declined, pending, charged back, or refunded. With 73.9M rows, it is the primary billing analytics table, used for FTD (First Time Deposit) attribution, payment provider performance, fraud analysis, exchange revenue reporting, regulatory compliance segmentation, and customer lifecycle analytics.

The table combines data from three production sources:
1. **`Billing.Deposit`** — the core deposit ledger (direct passthrough for 35 columns)
2. **`Billing.Funding`** — payment instrument details (FundingTypeID, IsRefundExcluded, DocumentRequired, AFT flags)
3. **`Billing.RecurringDeposit`** — recurring deposit configuration (OUTER APPLY for IsRecurring flag)

Additionally, ~91 columns are extracted from XML blobs stored in `Billing.Deposit.PaymentData` and `Billing.Deposit.FundingData` using the DWH UDF `ExtractXMLValue`. These cover payment-method-specific fields that vary by funding type (credit card BIN details, bank account info, e-wallet data, etc.).

**ETL pattern** (`SP_Fact_BillingDeposit_DL_To_Synapse`):
1. DELETE rows from `Ext_FBD_Fact_BillingDeposit` for the ModificationDateID window
2. INSERT from staging into Ext_FBD (multi-source JOIN + XML extraction)
3. DELETE from main `Fact_BillingDeposit` for the window
4. INSERT from Ext_FBD into Fact_BillingDeposit
5. UPDATE `PlatformID` from `Fact_CustomerAction` WHERE ActionTypeID=14 matching on SessionID (second SP pass: `EXEC SP_Fact_BillingDeposit @Yesterday`)

**Amount capping**: As of 2025-04-17, an `Amount CASE` expression caps extreme values before storage to prevent outlier distortion in aggregations.

**PlatformID enrichment**: The platform the customer used when depositing is not stored in Billing.Deposit — it is looked up via a session-to-platform join against `Fact_CustomerAction` (ActionTypeID=14, session-based match) in a second ETL pass.

**Upstream wiki**: `Billing.Deposit` has a full upstream wiki (documented in DB_Schema) providing Tier 1 column descriptions for 35 DWH columns.

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Deposit Status Lifecycle

**What**: Deposits progress through states from submission through approval, decline, or reversal.

**Columns Involved**: `PaymentStatusID`, `RiskManagementStatusID`, `MatchStatusID`

**Rules**:
- `PaymentStatusID=2` (Approved) is the only successful terminal state — drives customer account crediting via Billing.AmountAdd in production
- `PaymentStatusID=35` (DeclineByRRE) represents real-time risk engine declines (~10.2% of deposits)
- `PaymentStatusID=13` (Pending), `5` (InProcess): intermediate states for offline/wire deposits
- States 11-12, 26, 37-39 represent post-approval reversals (Chargeback, Refund, and their reversals)
- For full state machine, see upstream wiki: Billing.Deposit §2.1

### 2.2 First Time Deposit (FTD)

**What**: `IsFTD=1` marks the customer's first ever approved deposit — the event that triggers marketing attribution and FTD bonus eligibility.

**Columns Involved**: `IsFTD`, `CID`, `DepositID`

**Rules**:
- Only one deposit per customer can have `IsFTD=1` (monotonic guarantee from production)
- `IsFTD=0` for DepositTypeID=4 (MoneyTransfer/internal transfer) regardless of deposit history
- ~60.6% of Billing.Deposit rows have IsFTD=1 (many customers deposit exactly once)
- DWH stores this as `int` (0/1) rather than `bit` in production

### 2.3 Amount and Exchange Rate

**What**: Deposits are stored in deposit currency (CurrencyID) and pre-computed to USD (AmountUSD).

**Columns Involved**: `Amount`, `CurrencyID`, `ExchangeRate`, `BaseExchangeRate`, `ExchangeFee`, `AmountUSD`

**Rules**:
- `Amount` is in deposit currency; stored as MONEY (4 decimal places)
- As of 2025-04-17: Amount is capped via CASE expression before storage (prevents extreme outlier values)
- `AmountUSD = Amount × ExchangeRate` (DWH-computed in ETL)
- `BaseExchangeRate` stores the rate before fee markup; `ExchangeFee` stores the fee
- For USD deposits: ExchangeRate=1.0, AmountUSD=Amount

### 2.4 XML-Extracted Payment Data (~91 Columns)

**What**: `Billing.Deposit.PaymentData` and `FundingData` store provider-specific XML blobs. The DWH ETL extracts ~91 attributes using `ExtractXMLValue(xml_blob, attribute_name)` into dedicated nvarchar(max) columns.

**Rules**:
- Each `*AsString`, `*AsDecimal`, `*AsInteger` suffix column is a single XML attribute extracted by name
- The payment data schema varies by FundingTypeID — credit card deposits populate card-specific fields; bank wire deposits populate bank-specific fields; e-wallet deposits populate e-wallet fields
- NULL in any XML column means either: (a) the attribute doesn't exist for this funding type, or (b) it was absent from the XML for this deposit
- `ThreeDsResponseType` is a notable XML-extracted field — joins to Dim_ThreeDsResponseTypes via TRY_CAST(...AS INT)

### 2.5 Platform Attribution

**What**: `PlatformID` identifies the device/platform the customer was on when making the deposit (web, iOS, Android, etc.).

**Columns Involved**: `PlatformID`, `SessionID`

**Rules**:
- `PlatformID` is NOT from Billing.Deposit — it's populated via a second ETL pass:
  `UPDATE Fact_BillingDeposit SET PlatformID = (SELECT PlatformID FROM Fact_CustomerAction WHERE ActionTypeID=14 AND SessionID = Fact_BillingDeposit.SessionID)`
- If no matching Fact_CustomerAction row exists for the session, PlatformID remains NULL
- ActionTypeID=14 represents a "Deposit" action type in Fact_CustomerAction

### 2.6 Recurring Deposits

**What**: `IsRecurring` identifies deposits that are part of a scheduled recurring deposit plan.

**Columns Involved**: `IsRecurring`, `DepositID`

**Rules**:
- `IsRecurring = 1` when a matching row exists in `Billing.RecurringDeposit` for this deposit (OUTER APPLY)
- `IsRecurring = 0` for one-time deposits
- Recurring deposits may have DepositTypeID=3 (Recurring) or DepositTypeID=5 (RecurringInvestment)

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

`HASH(DepositID)` ensures even distribution — each deposit has a unique ID so this is an optimal hash key for point lookups and JOINs by deposit. The clustered index on `DepositID` makes per-deposit point lookups fast. The NC index on `(PaymentStatusID, ExpirationDateID)` supports filtered queries by status and expiration date.

**Warning**: At 73.9M rows, full-table scans are expensive. Always filter by `ModificationDateID` or `PaymentStatusID`.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Daily approved deposit volume | WHERE PaymentStatusID=2, GROUP BY ModificationDateID |
| FTD analysis | WHERE IsFTD=1 AND PaymentStatusID=2 |
| Exchange fee revenue | SUM(AmountUSD - Amount/ExchangeRate×BaseExchangeRate) |
| Regulation-specific deposits | WHERE ProcessRegulationID = @regId |
| Platform breakdown | GROUP BY PlatformID (JOIN Dim_Platform) |
| 3DS outcome analysis | TRY_CAST(ThreeDsResponseType AS INT) JOIN Dim_ThreeDsResponseTypes |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON CID | Customer demographics |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Date | ON ModificationDateID | Time dimension |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Currency | ON CurrencyID | Currency name |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Platform | ON PlatformID | Device/platform |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_ThreeDsResponseTypes | ON TRY_CAST(ThreeDsResponseType AS INT) | 3DS outcome |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **73.9M rows**: Always filter. Prefer ModificationDateID or ExpirationDateID index for range queries
- **XML columns are all nvarchar(max)**: Aggregating or joining on XML-extracted columns requires TRY_CAST — they are stored as strings regardless of semantic type
- **`v` column**: This unnamed column (`v`) is an XML-extracted field with no descriptive name — artifact of the XML schema. Contents unknown without domain review
- **PlatformID may be NULL**: Session-to-platform join succeeds only if the deposit session was logged in Fact_CustomerAction
- **AmountUSD is ETL-computed**: Not from production; recalculated as Amount×ExchangeRate at ETL time. For exact USD reconciliation, use Amount×ExchangeRate directly
- **ExpirationDateID formula**: Complex derived calculation from ExpirationDateAsString XML field — not a simple date conversion
