## 1. Business Meaning

`DWH_dbo.Dim_Mirror` is the DWH's primary record of all copy-trading relationships on the eToro platform. A "mirror" is the connection established when Customer A (the copier, `CID`) chooses to copy Customer B (the copied person, `ParentCID`/`ParentUserName`). Once established, trades opened by B are automatically mirrored proportionally in A's account, scaled to the mirror's `Amount`.

The table covers the full history of eToro's social trading product from its earliest CopyTrader relationships in 2011 through the present. It holds 11,145,368 rows across four mirror types: Regular copy (85.2%), Fund mirrors (14.1%), CopyMe/Popular Investor (0.7%), and Smart Portfolio/Social Index (0.001%).

**ETL pattern**: Incremental daily differential. The SP (`SP_Dim_Mirror_DL_To_Synapse`) merges updates from two staging sources:
1. `etoro_Trade_Mirror` -- real-time active mirrors (open positions)
2. `etoro_History_Mirror` -- historical/closed mirrors (close events with final P&L)

Rows are never deleted from Dim_Mirror (except for same-day re-processing). The `CloseDateID=0` / `CloseOccurred='1900-01-01'` sentinel marks currently open mirrors.

---

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Open vs. Closed Mirror Sentinel

**What**: A mirror may be open (still actively copying) or closed. The SP uses sentinel values to distinguish open mirrors from closed ones.

**Columns Involved**: `CloseOccurred`, `CloseDateID`, `IsActive`

**Rules**:
- **Open mirror**: `CloseDateID = 0`, `CloseOccurred = '1900-01-01 00:00:00'`. This is the active sentinel -- the copier is still copying.
- **Closed mirror**: `CloseDateID > 0`, `CloseOccurred` = actual close datetime. The copier stopped copying.
- **IsActive**: Production flag from Trade.Mirror / History.Mirror. Can be 0 for rows where `CloseDateID=0` (e.g., paused or deactivated but not formally closed). Do not rely on IsActive alone for open/closed filtering -- use `CloseDateID = 0`.
- **For filtering active mirrors**: `WHERE CloseDateID = 0` (669,921 currently open: 468,911 Regular + 9 CopyMe + 201,001 Fund)

### 2.2 Dual-Source ETL (Real vs. History)

**What**: Open mirrors come from `Trade.Mirror` (real-time system table); closed mirrors come from `History.Mirror` (event log). The daily SP merges both.

**Rules**:
- `etoro_Trade_Mirror` provides the current state of each open mirror (IsActive, Amount, risk settings, running P&L).
- `etoro_History_Mirror MirrorOperationID=2` provides close events (CloseOccurred, CloseDateID, RealziedPnL at close).
- `etoro_History_Mirror MirrorOperationID=1` provides open events (SessionID at open time).
- When a mirror appears in both History (closed today) and Real (still shown as open), History takes precedence (duplicates removed).
- Close dates with CloseOccurred >= today are treated as still-open and get sentinel values (1900-01-01, CloseDateID=0).

### 2.3 IsCopyFundMirror Derivation

**What**: `IsCopyFundMirror` identifies mirrors where the copied entity is an eToro-managed fund account, not a regular customer.

**Rule**: `IsCopyFundMirror = 1` when `ParentCID` is in `etoro_BackOffice_Customer WHERE AccountTypeID = 9` (Fund account type). NULL/0 for regular customer-to-customer copies. Fund mirrors are a distinct product from the Regular CopyTrader relationship.

### 2.4 RealziedPnL Typo

**What**: The column `RealziedPnL` contains the realized profit/loss for the mirror (net profit at close). The column name has a persistent typo ("Realzied" instead of "Realized") that exists in both the DDL and the SP.

**Rule**: This column is populated from `History.Mirror.NetProfit` at close time. For open mirrors, it reflects the running net profit at the last SP update. Always reference as `RealziedPnL` (with the typo) in queries -- the DDL name is authoritative.

### 2.5 MirrorSL and Risk Controls

**What**: Copy-trading relationships can have a stop-loss that automatically closes the mirror if losses exceed a threshold.

**Columns Involved**: `MirrorSL`, `MirrorSLPercentage`, `PauseCopy`

**Rules**:
- `MirrorSL`: Stop-loss amount in absolute USD terms. Mirror closes if cumulative loss reaches this amount.
- `MirrorSLPercentage`: Stop-loss as percentage of `InitialInvestment`. A setting of 40 means "close mirror if I lose 40% of my initial investment".
- `PauseCopy`: 1 if the copier has paused the copy (no new trades are mirrored). Paused copies are still open (CloseDateID=0) but not actively mirroring new trades.

---

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**HASH(MirrorID)**: MirrorID is the distribution key. JOINs on MirrorID are co-located (no shuffle). JOINs on CID, ParentCID, or OpenDateID may require broadcast/shuffle -- consider the fact table's distribution when planning multi-table JOINs.

**CLUSTERED INDEX (OpenDateID, MirrorID)**: Optimized for date-filtered queries on OpenDateID + MirrorID lookup. The two NC indexes support:
- `IX_Dim_Mirror`: OpenOccurred scans (datetime-based open date filtering)
- `IX_Dim_Mirror_ParentCID`: ParentCID lookups (find all copiers of a given Popular Investor)

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Count currently active copy relationships | `WHERE CloseDateID = 0 AND MirrorTypeID = 1` |
| Find all copiers of a specific Popular Investor | `WHERE ParentCID = X AND MirrorTypeID IN (1, 2)` |
| Mirror P&L attribution | `JOIN Dim_Mirror ON MirrorID; SELECT RealziedPnL, InitialInvestment` |
| Date-range analysis of new copy relationships | `WHERE OpenDateID BETWEEN 20250101 AND 20250131` |
| Identify copies with stop-loss set | `WHERE MirrorSL > 0 OR MirrorSLPercentage > 0` |
| Find paused copies | `WHERE PauseCopy = 1 AND CloseDateID = 0` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_MirrorType | `ON MirrorTypeID` | Get copy type name (Regular, CopyMe, Social Index, Fund) |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Date | `ON OpenDateID` or `CloseDateID` | Calendar metadata for open/close dates |
| CustomerStatic (or similar) | `ON CID` | Copier customer details |
| CustomerStatic | `ON ParentCID` | Copied person (Popular Investor) details |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **CloseOccurred='1900-01-01' = open mirror**: Do NOT interpret this as a historical date. It is the ETL sentinel for "not yet closed". Filter `WHERE CloseDateID = 0` for open mirrors.
- **RealziedPnL has a typo**: Column name is `RealziedPnL` (not `RealizedPnL`). This is the authoritative DDL name -- use the typo in queries.
- **IsActive is not a reliable closed indicator**: Use `CloseDateID = 0` for "is open". IsActive can be 0 for open-but-paused mirrors.
- **11.1M rows, never truncated**: Full table scans are expensive. Always filter on `OpenDateID` (clustered key) or `MirrorID` (distribution/hash key) for efficient queries.
- **MirrorTypeID=3 (Social Index) only 122 rows**: This product type has minimal representation -- likely a legacy or very limited product.
- **IsCopyFundMirror NULL vs 0**: The column can be NULL (not set in older rows) or 0/1. `ISNULL(IsCopyFundMirror, 0) = 1` for fund mirror filtering.
- **SessionID NULL for old rows**: The SessionID column was added later; historical mirrors (pre-2011 to early 2020s) may have NULL SessionID.
