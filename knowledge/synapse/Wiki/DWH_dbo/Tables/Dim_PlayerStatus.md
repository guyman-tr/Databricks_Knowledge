## 1. Business Meaning

Dim_PlayerStatus defines 16 distinct account restriction states in the eToro platform, each encoding a granular permission matrix controlling what a user can and cannot do. Unlike Dim_AccountStatus (binary open/closed), PlayerStatus provides fine-grained control over trading, deposits, withdrawals, social features, and copy-trading. This enables compliance and fraud teams to surgically restrict specific capabilities without full account lockout.

The data originates from `etoro.Dictionary.PlayerStatus` on the etoroDB-REAL production SQL Server. The Generic Pipeline exports this table daily (Override) to the data lake, and `SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse` loads it via TRUNCATE + INSERT, plus a separate sentinel INSERT for ID=0 (N/A placeholder). The ETL adds 4 computed columns (DWHPlayerStatusID, StatusID, UpdateDate, InsertDate) and **drops 2 production columns** (`CanCopy` and `GetsInterest`).

PlayerStatusID is stored in Dim_Customer and is read by virtually every user-facing operation -- login, trading, funding, social posting, and copy-trading -- to enforce permission checks. The permission flags are queried directly from this table rather than hardcoded in business logic.

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 Permission Matrix System

**What**: Each player status defines a complete set of boolean permissions that gate platform features.

**Columns Involved**: `IsBlocked`, `CanEditPosition`, `CanOpenPosition`, `CanClosePosition`, `CanDeposit`, `CanRequestWithdraw`, `CanLogin`, `CanChatAndPost`, `CanBeCopied`

**Rules**:
- **Full Block** (IsBlocked=1): IDs 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 14 -- user cannot log in. All capabilities disabled.
- **Partial Restriction**: IDs 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 -- user can access some features but not others.
- **Full Access**: IDs 1, 5 -- all capabilities enabled. ID=5 (Warning) is identical to Normal in permissions but signals compliance flagging.
- **Close-Only / Wind-Down**: IDs 9 (Trade & MIMO Blocked) and 15 (Block Deposit & Trading) -- user can close existing positions and log in, but cannot open new positions or deposit.

**Diagram**:
```
Access Level Summary:
  ID=1  Normal                -- All capabilities ON
  ID=5  Warning               -- All ON + compliance flag
  ID=3  Chat Blocked          -- All ON except CanChatAndPost
  ID=10 Deposit Blocked       -- All ON except CanDeposit
  ID=12 Copy Block            -- All ON except CanBeCopied (note: DWH lacks CanCopy col)
  ID=9  Trade & MIMO Blocked  -- Close+Login only; no open/deposit/withdraw
  ID=13 Pending Verification  -- Close+Login only
  ID=15 Block Deposit&Trading -- Close+Login+Chat+Copy; no open/deposit
  ID=11 Social Index          -- All ON except CanDeposit + CanRequestWithdraw
  ID=2  Blocked               -- ALL OFF (full lockout, cannot login)
  ID=4  Blocked Upon Request  -- ALL OFF (self-requested lockout)
  ID=6  Under Investigation   -- ALL OFF (compliance hold)
  ID=7  Scalpers Block        -- ALL OFF (trading abuse)
  ID=8  PayPal Investigation  -- ALL OFF (payment fraud)
  ID=14 Failed Verification   -- ALL OFF (KYC failure)
  ID=0  N/A                   -- All OFF (DWH ETL placeholder)
```

### 2.2 Status Transition Patterns

**What**: Common pathways between player statuses driven by compliance, fraud, and user lifecycle events.

**Columns Involved**: `PlayerStatusID`

**Rules**:
- New accounts: 1 (Normal) or 13 (Pending Verification) depending on regulation
- Compliance investigation: 1 -> 6 (Under Investigation) -> 1 (cleared) or 2 (blocked)
- KYC timeout: 13 (Pending) -> 14 (Failed Verification) if docs not submitted
- Self-service closure: 1 -> 4 (Blocked Upon Request)
- Scalping detection: 1 -> 7 (Scalpers Block)
- PayPal fraud: 1 -> 8 (PayPal Investigation)
- Wind-down: 1 -> 9 or 15 (close-only mode for accounts under investigation)

### 2.3 Schema Drift -- Dropped Production Columns

**What**: Two production permission columns are not loaded into DWH.

**Dropped**:
- `CanCopy` (bit, default 1) -- whether user can copy other traders. Status 12 (Copy Block) sets this to 0.
- `GetsInterest` (bit) -- whether overnight fees/credits apply to user's positions. NOT available in DWH.

**Impact**: Analysts cannot determine from DWH whether a given status blocks copy-trading (CanCopy) or overnight interest (GetsInterest). For these, query production or the upstream wiki.

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, this table is REPLICATE-distributed with a HEAP index. HEAP means no CCI/sort -- for 16 rows this is irrelevant to performance, but row order is arbitrary without ORDER BY. Always join on `PlayerStatusID`. With REPLICATE, JOINs are zero-cost (all nodes have a full copy).

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage & Partitioning

**In Databricks**, no partitioning needed. Full scan of 16 rows is trivial.

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resolve a PlayerStatusID to a name | JOIN Dim_PlayerStatus ON PlayerStatusID |
| Find customers who cannot trade | JOIN Dim_Customer, filter CanOpenPosition = 0 or IsBlocked = 1 |
| Count customers by restriction category | GROUP BY IsBlocked + CanOpenPosition combination |
| Find wind-down accounts (close-only) | Filter CanClosePosition = 1 AND CanOpenPosition = 0 |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Customer | ON dc.PlayerStatusID = dps.PlayerStatusID | Resolve status name and permission flags per customer |
| DWH_dbo.V_Dim_Customer | ON vdc.PlayerStatusID = dps.PlayerStatusID | View-level status resolution |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_SnapshotCustomer | ON fsc.PlayerStatusID = dps.PlayerStatusID | Customer status in daily snapshots |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **HEAP index**: Like Dim_PlayerLevel, this table uses HEAP. No guaranteed row order without ORDER BY.
- **ID=0 sentinel**: All permission bits are 0 for ID=0 (N/A). LEFT JOIN if the fact table may have NULL or missing PlayerStatusID.
- **CanCopy and GetsInterest are MISSING**: These two production columns are not in DWH. Analysts needing copy-block or interest-eligibility logic must use production data.
- **Status 5 (Warning) = same permissions as Status 1 (Normal)**: All permission flags are identical. The only difference is the compliance signal encoded in the ID itself.
- **Status names have trailing spaces**: Live data shows "Blocked" with trailing whitespace for some status names (e.g., Name column for ID=2). Apply RTRIM() in comparisons if matching by name string.

| # | Element | Type | Nullable | Description |
|---|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | PlayerStatusID | int | NO | Primary key identifying the restriction state. 0=N/A (sentinel), 1=Normal, 2=Blocked, 3=Chat Blocked, 4=Blocked Upon Request, 5=Warning, 6=Under Investigation, 7=Scalpers Block, 8=PayPal Investigation, 9=Trade & MIMO Blocked, 10=Deposit Blocked, 11=Social Index, 12=Copy Block, 13=Pending Verification, 14=Failed Verification, 15=Block Deposit & Trading. FK from Dim_Customer. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, Dictionary.PlayerStatus) |
| 2 | Name | varchar(50) | NO | Human-readable restriction state label. Unique per status. Used in BackOffice UI, compliance reports, and monitoring dashboards. Note: some values have trailing spaces in live data -- apply RTRIM() for string comparisons. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, Dictionary.PlayerStatus) |
| 3 | IsBlocked | bit | NO | Master block flag. 1 for statuses 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 14 -- ALL capabilities disabled including login. 0 for statuses where individual CanX flags control granular permissions. Checked by login and order entry procedures. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, Dictionary.PlayerStatus) |
| 4 | CanEditPosition | bit | YES | Whether the user can modify existing position parameters (SL/TP/trailing stop). False when IsBlocked=1 and for close-only statuses (9, 13, 15). (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, Dictionary.PlayerStatus) |
| 5 | CanOpenPosition | bit | YES | Whether the user can open new trading positions. False when IsBlocked=1 and for close-only statuses (9, 13, 15). True for all active/warning/partial statuses. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, Dictionary.PlayerStatus) |
| 6 | CanClosePosition | bit | YES | Whether the user can close existing positions. True even for most restricted statuses -- regulators require users to be able to exit. Only IsBlocked=1 statuses set this to False. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, Dictionary.PlayerStatus) |
| 7 | CanDeposit | bit | YES | Whether the user can add funds to their account. False for full-block statuses (IsBlocked=1), close-only statuses (9, 15), status 10 (Deposit Blocked), and status 11 (Social Index). (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, Dictionary.PlayerStatus) |

| 10 | CanChatAndPost | bit | YES | Whether the user can post to the social feed or chat. False when IsBlocked=1 and for status 3 (Chat Blocked). True for all other statuses including close-only. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, Dictionary.PlayerStatus) |
| 11 | CanBeCopied | bit | YES | Whether other users can start copying this user's trades. False when IsBlocked=1. Used to hide restricted users from the CopyTrader marketplace. Note: CanCopy (whether THIS user can copy others) is NOT loaded into DWH. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, Dictionary.PlayerStatus) |
| 12 | DWHPlayerStatusID | int | YES | DWH surrogate key -- always equals PlayerLevelID (redundant copy). Set by ETL: SELECT [PlayerStatusID] AS [DWHPlayerStatusID]. 0 for the ID=0 sentinel. (Tier 2 - SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse) |
| 13 | StatusID | int | YES | Hardcoded to 1 (active) for all rows by the ETL. Not derived from production source. Standard DWH ETL convention for SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse-loaded tables. (Tier 2 - SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse) |
| 14 | UpdateDate | datetime | YES | ETL load timestamp -- GETDATE() for production rows; @ddate (midnight) for ID=0 sentinel. Does not reflect production data modification time. (Tier 2 - SP_Dictionaries_DL_To_Synapse) |
