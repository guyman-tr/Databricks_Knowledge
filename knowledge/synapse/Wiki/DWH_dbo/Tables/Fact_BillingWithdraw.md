# DWH_dbo.Fact_BillingWithdraw

> Denormalized withdrawal fact table; each row combines a customer withdrawal request (Billing.Withdraw), its payment execution leg (Billing.WithdrawToFunding), and the funding instrument metadata (Billing.Funding) into a single wide row with XML-extracted payment details and BIN-code enrichment, providing a one-stop analytics surface for withdrawal operations, cashout monitoring, and regulatory reporting.

## 1. Business Meaning

`Fact_BillingWithdraw` is the DWH's primary withdrawal analytics table. It denormalizes three production tables into a single row per withdrawal-to-funding execution:

1. **Billing.Withdraw** (`bw`): The withdrawal request — customer ID, amount, status, fees, request date
2. **Billing.WithdrawToFunding** (`wtf`): The payment execution leg — processing currency, exchange rate, payment status, depot routing
3. **Billing.Funding** (`bf`): The funding instrument — payment method metadata extracted from XML

The ETL uses `DWH_dbo.ExtractXMLValue()` to parse ~40 fields from the XML blobs (`wtf.WithdrawData` and `bf.FundingData`), flattening provider-specific payment details (card numbers, bank accounts, IBAN codes, etc.) into queryable columns. Many fields use a COALESCE pattern that tries the WithdrawToFunding XML first, falling back to the Funding XML when unavailable.

After the main load, `SP_Fact_BillingWithdraw` enriches each day's rows with `BankName` (issuing bank) and `CardCategory` from `Dim_CountryBin` matched on BIN code.

### Business Usage

- **Regulatory Reporting**: Confluence "Business & Regulatory Undertakings Monitoring Platform" queries `Fact_BillingWithdraw WHERE Fee>0` for withdrawal fee monitoring
- **Cashout Fee Analysis**: Confluence "Cashout Fee" joins to `Dim_CashoutReason`, `Dim_BillingDepot`, `Dim_FundingType`, `Dim_CardType` for fee breakdowns by regulation, club, country, and account type
- **Deposits & Withdrawals Reporting**: Confluence "Deposits and withdrawals - DWH" uses this table alongside `Fact_BillingDeposit` for combined payment flow analysis

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 ETL Pipeline (SP_Fact_BillingWithdraw_DL_To_Synapse)

```
Step 1: DELETE existing rows for @dt day (ModificationDateID range)
Step 2: TRUNCATE Ext_FBW_Fact_BillingWithdraw
Step 3: INSERT into Ext from 3-way staging JOIN:
        bw LEFT JOIN wtf ON WithdrawID
           LEFT JOIN bf ON FundingID
        WHERE bw.ModificationDate in @dt day range
        → ExtractXMLValue() for ~40 columns from XML
        → COALESCE(wtf.WithdrawData, bf.FundingData) for shared fields
Step 4: DELETE existing in Fact matching by WithdrawID (upsert pattern)
Step 5: INSERT from Ext into Fact_BillingWithdraw
Step 6: EXEC SP_Fact_BillingWithdraw @date = @dt
```

### 2.2 Post-Load Enrichment (SP_Fact_BillingWithdraw)

```
Step 1: Wait for Dim_CountryBin to be loaded today (polling loop, 60s intervals)
Step 2: UPDATE BankName = cb.IssuingBank, CardCategory = cb.CardCategory
        FROM Fact_BillingWithdraw fbw
        JOIN Dim_CountryBin cb ON CAST(fbw.BinCodeAsString AS INT) = cb.BinCode
        WHERE ModificationDateID = @dateID
```

### 2.3 Dual Status Tracking

The table carries two CashoutStatusID columns reflecting different levels:
- **CashoutStatusID_Withdraw** (request level): Tracks the overall withdrawal request lifecycle. 71% of requests are Cancelled in production.
- **CashoutStatusID_Funding** (execution level): Tracks the specific payment leg execution. A request can be Processed overall while having multiple legs with different statuses.

Both reference `Dim_CashoutStatus`. Key values: 1=Pending, 2=InProcess, 3=Processed, 4=Cancelled.

### 2.4 Dual FundingType Tracking

- **FundingTypeID_Withdraw**: The payment method the customer selected when making the withdrawal request (from Billing.Withdraw)
- **FundingTypeID_Funding**: The payment method of the actual funding instrument receiving the payout (from Billing.Funding)

These may differ when the payout is routed to a different method than originally requested.

### 2.5 Dual Amount Tracking

- **Amount_Withdraw**: The gross withdrawal amount in the request currency (CurrencyID)
- **Amount_WithdrawToFunding**: The actual payout amount in the processing currency (ProcessCurrencyID)

The difference may be due to exchange rate conversion (ExchangeRate) and fees (Fee, ExchangeFee).

### 2.6 XML Extraction Pattern

~40 columns are extracted from XML blobs stored in the production `WithdrawData` and `FundingData` columns using `DWH_dbo.ExtractXMLValue()`. All are stored as `nvarchar(max)` regardless of their semantic type (some represent integers, decimals, dates). The COALESCE pattern for shared fields (BIN code, IBAN, SWIFT, etc.) prefers the payment execution data over the funding instrument data, as the execution-time data is more current.

### 2.7 BIN Code Enrichment

After the main ETL load, `SP_Fact_BillingWithdraw` enriches rows by matching `BinCodeAsString` (CAST to INT) against `Dim_CountryBin.BinCode` to populate `BankName` (issuing bank) and `CardCategory`. This step waits for `Dim_CountryBin` to be loaded for the current day, polling every 60 seconds.

### 2.8 Column Rename Disambiguation

| DWH Column | Source Column | Source Table | Why Renamed |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Amount_Withdraw | Amount | bw (Billing.Withdraw) | Disambiguate from WTF amount |
| Amount_WithdrawToFunding | Amount | wtf (Billing.WithdrawToFunding) | Payment leg amount in process currency |
| FundingTypeID_Withdraw | FundingTypeID | bw (Billing.Withdraw) | Payment method of the withdrawal request |
| FundingTypeID_Funding | FundingTypeID | bf (Billing.Funding) | Payment method of the funding instrument |
| CashoutStatusID_Withdraw | CashoutStatusID | bw (Billing.Withdraw) | Request-level status |
| CashoutStatusID_Funding | CashoutStatusID | wtf (Billing.WithdrawToFunding) | Execution-level status |
| ModificationDate_WithdrawToFunding | ModificationDate | wtf (Billing.WithdrawToFunding) | Execution leg last modified |
| WithdrawPaymentID | ID | wtf (Billing.WithdrawToFunding) | WTF surrogate key |

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Distribution & Indexing

- **HASH(WithdrawID)**: Queries filtering on `WithdrawID` are single-node. Customer-level queries (by CID) require data movement across distributions.
- **Clustered Index**: WithdrawID ASC — efficient for point lookups and range scans by WithdrawID.
- **NCI on ExpirationDateID**: Supports card expiration-based queries (compliance, PCI reporting).

### 3.2 Data Freshness

- Daily incremental load based on `ModificationDate` in the source
- Post-load BIN enrichment depends on `Dim_CountryBin` being loaded first (blocking dependency with polling)
- `UpdateDate` reflects the ETL execution timestamp

## 4. Elements

> Note: Upstream production wikis available for Billing.Withdraw (9.5/10), Billing.WithdrawToFunding (9.1/10), and Billing.Funding. Tier 1 descriptions inherited verbatim from upstream where columns are passthrough or renamed. XML-extracted columns (parsed from WithdrawData/FundingData XML blobs via ExtractXMLValue) are Tier 2 because they are not table-level columns in the source — they are values inside an XML document.
