## 1. Business Meaning

Fact_SnapshotCustomer is the central customer state table in the DWH. For every eToro customer (RealCID), it holds one row per distinct attribute state within a year, recording which attributes were active between FromDate and ToDate (encoded together in `DateRangeID`). The pattern is SCD Type 2 by year: each year's rows are closed as attribute changes occur, and a new open row is created with the updated state. At year-end, all open rows are closed and reopened with the new year's date range.

As of 2026-03-19: **406M+ total rows**, **46.4M distinct customers**, data from **2007-08-22 to present**. 302M rows are "currently open" (ToDate = year-end). 11.9% of current open rows represent depositors; 98.0% are valid customers (IsValidCustomer=1).

The SP loads data from 6 source systems via staging Ext_FSC tables pre-populated by SP_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_DL_To_Synapse. The core CC (Customer Core) source provides demographics and status; the BO (Back Office) source provides risk/compliance attributes. RegulationID is taken from RegulationChangeLog — **not** from Back Office — because regulation changes take effect end-of-day.

8 legacy columns (DemoCID, CustomerChangeTypeID, CurentValue, PreviousValue, DocsOK, Bankruptcy, PremiumAccount, Evangelist) are present in the DDL but NOT populated by the current SP. They carry DEFAULT (0) values.

## 2. Business Logic

### 2.1 SCD Type 2 Pattern — DateRangeID

**What**: Each customer-state row has a DateRangeID encoding both the open date (FromDate) and close date (ToDate) as a 12-digit bigint.

**Columns Involved**: `DateRangeID`, `RealCID`

**Rules**:
- DateRangeID = `YYYYMMDD` (open date, 8 chars) + `MMDDD` (year-end month+day, 4 chars) → e.g., `202603101231` = opened 2026-03-10, closes 2026-12-31
- When an attribute changes, the SP updates DateRangeID of the existing row to close it (right 4 chars become yesterday's MMDD), then inserts a new row with today's open date + year-end
- To get the **most current row** per customer: `RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4) = '1231'`
- On January 1st: all prior year's open rows are closed (12-31) and re-opened for the new year
- The `Dim_Range` dimension table stores FromDateID + ToDateID for each DateRangeID

### 2.2 IsValidCustomer — Segment Flag

**What**: Computed flag indicating whether a customer is a "valid" retail customer for analytics (excludes demo, blocked countries, excluded labels).

**Columns Involved**: `IsValidCustomer`, `PlayerLevelID`, `LabelID`, `CountryID`

**Rules** (as of post-2020-03-14):
```
IsValidCustomer = 1 IF:
  PlayerLevelID <> 4 (not demo)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (30, 26) (not internal/excluded label)
  AND CountryID <> 250 (not blocked country)
ELSE 0
```
Pre-2020-03-14 rule additionally excluded AccountTypeID=9.

### 2.3 IsCreditReportValidCB — Credit Reporting Flag

**What**: Flag indicating whether a customer is eligible for credit report validation (CB = CreditBureau context).

**Columns Involved**: `IsCreditReportValidCB`, `PlayerLevelID`, `AccountTypeID`, `LabelID`, `CountryID`

**Rules** (as of post-2020-03-14):
```
IsCreditReportValidCB = 1 IF:
  NOT (PlayerLevelID = 4 AND AccountTypeID <> 2)  (not non-real demo)
  AND LabelID NOT IN (26, 30)
  AND NOT (CountryID = 250 AND CID NOT IN (3400616, 10526243))
ELSE 0
```

### 2.4 RegulationID — End-of-Day Rule

**What**: A customer's regulatory jurisdiction is taken from RegulationChangeLog (end-of-day change), NOT from the back-office system (immediate change), because regulation changes take effect at end of day for business/legal reasons.

**Columns Involved**: `RegulationID`, sourced from `Ext_FSC_BackOffice_RegulationChangeLog.ToRegulationID`

### 2.5 GDPR Erasure Masking

**What**: When a GDPR deletion request is processed, the UserName in Customer Core gets a `DelUserName` prefix. The SP detects this and masks Email, City, Address, Zip, and PhoneNumber in Fact_SnapshotCustomer.

**Columns Involved**: `Email`, `City`, `Address`, `Zip`, `PhoneNumber`

## 3. Query Advisory

### 3.1 Synapse Distribution & Index

**In Synapse**, HASH(RealCID) distribution + CCI makes per-customer aggregations and filters on RealCID highly efficient — queries that filter or join on RealCID benefit from colocation. The NCI on RealCID provides efficient point-lookup for single customers.

**Warning**: With 406M rows, full table scans are expensive. Always filter by DateRangeID or a specific year range when possible.

### 3.1b UC (Databricks) Storage

**In Databricks**, the data is accessed via `V_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_FromDateID` (generic_id=1115), not directly. Two UC targets:
- `pii_data.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_v_fact_snapshotcustomer_fromdateid` — full PII (gated access)
- `dwh.gold_sql_dp_prod_we_dwh_dbo_v_fact_snapshotcustomer_fromdateid_masked` — Email/City/Address/Zip masked

### 3.2 Common Query Patterns

| Analyst Question | Recommended Approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Current state for all customers | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` |
| Current state for one customer | `WHERE RealCID = @cid AND RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` |
| Customer state on a specific date | `WHERE RealCID = @cid AND LEFT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),8) <= @date AND RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) >= RIGHT(@date, 4)` |
| Count of depositors | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231' AND IsDepositor = 1` |
| Valid retail customers | `WHERE RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231' AND IsValidCustomer = 1` |

### 3.3 Common JOINs

| Join To | Join Condition | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Country | ON f.CountryID = dc.CountryID | Country name/region |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Label | ON f.LabelID = dl.LabelID | Brand/label name |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Language | ON f.LanguageID = dl.LanguageID | Customer language |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_VerificationLevel | ON f.VerificationLevelID = dv.VerificationLevelID | KYC verification status |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_PlayerStatus | ON f.PlayerStatusID = dp.PlayerStatusID | Account lifecycle status |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Regulation | ON f.RegulationID = dr.RegulationID | Regulatory jurisdiction |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_AccountStatus | ON f.AccountStatusID = das.AccountStatusID | Account enabled/disabled |
| DWH_dbo.Dim_Range | ON f.DateRangeID = dr.DateRangeID | Decode FromDateID + ToDateID |
| DWH_dbo.Fact_Guru_Copiers | ON f.RealCID = fg.RealCID | Copy-trading activity |

### 3.4 Gotchas

- **DateRangeID is NOT a date** — it is a 12-digit bigint encoding (FromDate)(ToDate MMDD). Always extract with LEFT(...,8) for FromDate and RIGHT(...,4) for ToDate MMDD.
- **Most-current-row filter**: `RIGHT(CAST(DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)),4) = '1231'` gets the currently open row, but after year-end closure this may temporarily return 0 rows. Use `MAX(DateRangeID)` per RealCID as a safer alternative.
- **Legacy columns with 0 defaults**: DemoCID, CustomerChangeTypeID, CurentValue, PreviousValue, DocsOK, Bankruptcy, PremiumAccount, Evangelist are all DEFAULT 0 and NOT populated by the current SP. Do not rely on them.
- **PII masking**: Email, City, Address, Zip are dynamically masked (`MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'default()')`). Users without `UNMASK` permission see NULL. PhoneNumber is NOT masked at DDL level but is GDPR-erased via the SP for deleted users.
- **WeekendFeePrecentage** (note: typo in column name — "Precentage" instead of "Percentage") — use as-is.
- **AccountStatusID distribution**: 1=93.2% (Active), 0=6.1% (unknown/default), 2=0.9% (Inactive). Only 3 distinct values observed.
- **Not exported directly to UC** — join via `V_Fact_SnapshotCustomer_FromDateID` in UC.

  AND RIGHT(CAST(f.DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4) = '1231';
```

### 7.2 Count of valid retail depositors by country (current snapshot)

```sql
SELECT

    COUNT(DISTINCT f.RealCID) AS depositor_count
FROM [DWH_dbo].[Fact_SnapshotCustomer] f
JOIN [DWH_dbo].[Dim_Country] dc ON f.CountryID = dc.CountryID
WHERE RIGHT(CAST(f.DateRangeID AS VARCHAR(12)), 4) = '1231'
  AND f.IsDepositor = 1
  AND f.IsValidCustomer = 1
GROUP BY dc.CountryName
ORDER BY depositor_count DESC;
```
