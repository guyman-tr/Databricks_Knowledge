-- Column Comments
ALTER TABLE main.bi_db.bronze_walletdb_eligibility_travelrulewhitelistedaddresses ALTER COLUMN Id COMMENT 'Auto-incrementing surrogate key. Each row represents one verified address-customer-blockchain combination. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, WalletDB.Eligibility.TravelRuleWhitelistedAddresses)';
ALTER TABLE main.bi_db.bronze_walletdb_eligibility_travelrulewhitelistedaddresses ALTER COLUMN Gcid COMMENT 'Global Customer ID identifying the customer who proved ownership of this address. Used in the uniqueness check: an address whitelisted for one Gcid cannot be claimed by another. Also used by AddWhitelistedAddressAndUpdateTravelRuleStatus to match pending travel rule transactions. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, WalletDB.Eligibility.TravelRuleWhitelistedAddresses)';
ALTER TABLE main.bi_db.bronze_walletdb_eligibility_travelrulewhitelistedaddresses ALTER COLUMN BlockchainCryptoId COMMENT 'Identifies the blockchain network of the whitelisted address. Values observed: 1=Bitcoin (59%), 2=Ethereum (37%), 18=Cardano (3%), 6 and 19=other chains. Part of the uniqueness constraint alongside Gcid and Address. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, WalletDB.Eligibility.TravelRuleWhitelistedAddresses)';
ALTER TABLE main.bi_db.bronze_walletdb_eligibility_travelrulewhitelistedaddresses ALTER COLUMN Created COMMENT 'UTC timestamp of when the whitelist entry was created. Set to GETUTCDATE() by all three writer procedures on INSERT. Indexed as part of a composite covering index with Gcid, BlockchainCryptoId, and Address. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, WalletDB.Eligibility.TravelRuleWhitelistedAddresses)';
ALTER TABLE main.bi_db.bronze_walletdb_eligibility_travelrulewhitelistedaddresses ALTER COLUMN Address COMMENT 'The full blockchain address string that has been verified. Format varies by blockchain: "0x..." for Ethereum, "addr1q..." for Cardano, various formats for Bitcoin. Has a dedicated nonclustered index for fast lookup by GetTravelRuleWhitelistedAddress. The uniqueness enforcement logic checks this column across all customers. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, WalletDB.Eligibility.TravelRuleWhitelistedAddresses)';
ALTER TABLE main.bi_db.bronze_walletdb_eligibility_travelrulewhitelistedaddresses ALTER COLUMN ProofOfOwnership COMMENT 'The actual proof data - either the cryptographic signature bytes or the signed declaration text. Stored as a large text/blob since cryptographic signatures can be lengthy. Used for compliance audit purposes. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, WalletDB.Eligibility.TravelRuleWhitelistedAddresses)';
ALTER TABLE main.bi_db.bronze_walletdb_eligibility_travelrulewhitelistedaddresses ALTER COLUMN ProofOfOwnershipTypeId COMMENT 'Method used to verify address ownership. FK to Dictionary.AddressOwnershipProofType: 1=Declaration (legal self-attestation), 2=Signature (cryptographic private key signing). In practice, 100% of current entries use Signature (2). See Address Ownership Proof Type. (Tier 1 - upstream wiki, WalletDB.Eligibility.TravelRuleWhitelistedAddresses)';
